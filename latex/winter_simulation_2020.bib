  abstract = {Numerical modelling is one way to improve understanding of the growth and response to external factors of high tidal mudflats and marshes. Theoretically, mudflat-marsh growth is determined by the rates of minerogenic and organogenic sedimentation, the rate of change and tendency of relative sea-level, and the rate of ``long-range'' sediment compaction. A numerical simulation model for mudflat-marsh growth using these ideas is described and implemented for the Severn Estuary on the basis of empirical knowledge of its tidal and fine-sediment regimes and of the present-day order of magnitude of the deposition rate of fine sediment in its upper intertidal zone. The predicted curve of vertical growth relative to the tidal frame at first rises very steeply but thereafter flattens rapidly. Its precise form depends on the balance between the terms of the governing equation. When relative sea-level is rising, a marsh may grow, after a certain maturation time, to a stable elevation in the moving tidal frame that is substantially less than the elevation of the extreme tide, a situation that could inhibit peat formation. When the tendency of relative sea-level is downward, or when the rate of organogenic sedimentation is sufficiently large, a marsh after a certain emergence time may rise above the tidal frame, with the consequence that peat growth is favoured. The exploratory model is supported by a published growth curve for tidal marshes in eastern England, and by the observed internal stratification and relative elevations of the salt marshes developed along the Severn Estuary.},

We attribute this elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation inside the embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest biomass, and a regionally increased tidal range. One major consequence of this elevation loss occurred in 2009 when the embankments of several large islands failed during Cyclone Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up to two years until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suffering during this time9,10, the newly reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres of tidally deposited sediment, equivalent to decades' worth of normal sedimentation. Although many areas still lie well below mean high water and remain at risk of severe flooding, we conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled embankment breaches.},

  abstract = {In parts of North America and Europe, present and future sedimentary deficits translate into major areal losses of coastal salt marsh. Physically based simulations of medium- to long-term adjustment to accelerated sea-level rise are few, partly due to the difficulty in extrapolating imperfectly understood sedimentation parameters. This paper outlines the implementation and application of a simple one-dimensional mass balance model designed to simulate the vertical adjustment of predominantly minerogenic marsh surfaces to various combinations of sediment supply, tidal levels and regional subsidence. Two aspects of marsh growth are examined, with reference to sites on the macro-tidal north Norfolk coast, U.K.: (i) historical marsh growth under a scenario of effective (long-term) eustatic stability but slow regional subsidence; and (ii) marsh response to various non-linear eustatic rise scenarios for the next century. In contrast to more organogenic North American marshes, sedimentation rates in Norfolk are strongly time-dependent. Where the overall sediment budget is so closely linked to marsh age and relative elevation, some form of numerical simulation offers a preferred means of predicting the impact of accelerated sea-level rise. Simulations performed here show that only the most dramatic eustatic scenarios result in ecological `drowning' and reversion to tidal flat within the conventional 2100 prediction interval. Currently favoured scenarios give rise to accretionary deficits which are clearly sustainable in the short-term, albeit at the expense of increased inundation frequency and consequent changes in the distribution of marsh flora and fauna.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The landscape of southwest Bangladesh, a region constructed primarily by fluvial processes associated with the Ganges River and Brahmaputra River, is now maintained almost exclusively by tidal processes as the fluvial system has migrated east and eliminated the most direct fluvial input. In natural areas such as the Sundarbans National Forest, year-round inundation during spring high tides delivers sufficient sediment that enables vertical accretion to keep pace with relative sea-level rise. However, recent human modification of the landscape in the form of embankment construction has terminated this pathway of sediment delivery for much of the region, resulting in a startling elevation imbalance, with inhabited areas often sitting \&gt;1\&thinsp;m below mean high water. Restoring this landscape, or preventing land loss in the natural system, requires an understanding of how rates of water and sediment flux vary across timescales ranging from hours to months. In this study, we combine time series observations of water level, salinity, and suspended sediment concentration with ship-based measurements of large tidal-channel hydrodynamics and sediment transport. To capture the greatest possible range of variability, cross-channel transects designed to encompass a 12.4\&thinsp;h tidal cycle were performed in both dry and wet seasons during spring and neap tides.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Regional suspended sediment concentration begins to increase in August, coincident with a decrease in local salinity, indicating the arrival of the sediment-laden, freshwater plume of the combined Ganges\textendash{}Brahmaputra\textendash{}Meghna rivers. We observe profound seasonality in sediment transport, despite comparatively modest seasonal variability in the magnitude of water discharge. These observations emphasize the importance of seasonal sediment delivery from the main-stem rivers to this remote tidal region. On tidal timescales, spring tides transport an order of magnitude more sediment than neap tides in both the wet and dry seasons. In aggregate, sediment transport is flood oriented, likely as a result of tidal pumping. Finally, we note that rates of sediment and water discharge in the tidal channels are of the same scale as the annually averaged values for the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. These observations provide context for examining the relative importance of fluvial and tidal processes in what has been defined as a quintessentially tidally influenced delta in the classification scheme of Galloway (1975). These data also inform critical questions regarding the timing and magnitude of sediment delivery to the region, which are especially important in predicting and preparing for responses of the natural system to ongoing environmental change.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Southwest Bangladesh, located on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, is experiencing the impacts of sea level rise (SLR) due to processes at both the local and global scale. In particular, regional alterations of the hydrodynamic network, due to embankment construction, have drastically altered effective SLR, placing millions of inhabitants at risk of prolonged inundation, and threatening the world's largest continuous mangrove stand, the Sundarbans National Forest (SNF). In order to effectively employ landscape recovery solutions, an understanding of local sediment transport and deposition is critical. This field-based study investigates the sediment dynamics between the mangrove platform and tidal channels of the SNF using data from a variety of instruments and sediment samples collected within a forested subbasin ({$\sim$}20 km2) fed by a major tidal channel. We observe profound seasonal variability within the sub-basin, with the wet season exhibiting a deeper and longer inundation of the mangrove platform and greater suspended sediment concentrations (SSC). Further, there exists a trend of decreasing SSC and median grain size from the perimeter of the SNF to the interior, and decreasing SSC from the tidal channel to the platform at both locations. We project seasonal platform sedimentation rates ranging from 0.17 {$\pm$} 0.16 cm in the dry season to 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.35 cm in the wet season. Importantly, the annual deposition rate measured at either location is sufficiently rapid to keep pace with observed rates of effective SLR published in other studies ({$\sim$}1.0\textendash{}1.7 cm/year). Based on our results, it appears that many controls on sedimentation are both covariant and of similar importance to land aggradation in the SNF. While inundation depth and frequency will likely increase under future SLR scenarios, sediment supply is threatened by India's proposed River Linking Project, which could decrease the sediment loads of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers by as much as 75 and 25\%, respectively. These rivers provide the sediment for the entire delta, and we predict that with decreasing SSC, some regions\textemdash{}particularly interior sediment depleted regions\textemdash{}may begin to deteriorate and become submerged, including within the SNF.},

In a model designed for the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium\textendash{}SW Netherlands), a feedback between inundation depth and suspended sediment concentrations allows marshes to quickly adjust their elevation to a change in sea-level rise rate. In a model designed for the North Inlet Estuary (South Carolina), a feedback between inundation and vegetation growth allows similar adjustment. Although the models differ in their approach, we find that they predict surprisingly similar responses to sea-level change. Marsh elevations adjust to a step change in the rate of sea-level rise in about 100 years. In the case of a continuous acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise, modeled accretion rates lag behind sea-level rise rates by about 20 years, and never obtain equilibrium. Regardless of the style of acceleration, the models predict approximately 6\textendash{}14cm of marsh submergence in response to historical sea-level acceleration, and 3\textendash{}4cm of marsh submergence in response to a projected scenario of sea-level rise over the next century. While marshes already low in the tidal frame would be susceptible to these depth changes, our modeling results suggest that factors other than historical sea-level acceleration are more important for observations of degradation in most marshes today.},

  abstract = {The evolution of tidal marsh platforms and interwoven channel networks cannot be addressed without treating the two-way interactions that link biological and physical processes. We have developed a 3D model of tidal marsh accretion and channel network development that couples physical sediment transport processes with vegetation biomass productivity. Tidal flow tends to cause erosion, whereas vegetation biomass, a function of bed surface depth below high tide, influences the rate of sediment deposition and slope-driven transport processes such as creek bank slumping. With a steady, moderate rise in sea level, the model builds a marsh platform and channel network with accretion rates everywhere equal to the rate of sea-level rise, meaning water depths and biological productivity remain temporally constant. An increase in the rate of sea-level rise, or a reduction in sediment supply, causes marsh-surface depths, biomass productivity, and deposition rates to increase while simultaneously causing the channel network to expand. Vegetation on the marsh platform can promote a metastable equilibrium where the platform maintains elevation relative to a rapidly rising sea level, although disturbance to vegetation could cause irreversible loss of marsh habitat.},

  abstract = {We describe and apply a point model of the joint evolution of tidal landforms and biota which incorporates the dynamics of intertidal vegetation; benthic microbial assemblages; erosional, depositional, and sediment exchange processes; wind-wave dynamics, and relative sea level change. Alternative stable states and punctuated equilibria emerge, characterized by possible sudden transitions of the system state, governed by vegetation type, disturbances of the benthic biofilm, sediment availability, and marine transgressions or regressions. Multiple stable states are suggested to result from the interplay of erosion, deposition, and biostabilization, providing a simple explanation for the ubiquitous presence of the typical landforms observed in tidal environments worldwide. The main properties of accessible equilibrium states prove robust with respect to specific modeling assumptions and are thus identified as characteristic dynamical features of tidal systems. Halophytic vegetation emerges as a key stabilizing factor through wave dissipation, rather than a major trapping agent, because the total inorganic deposition flux is found to be largely independent of standing biomass under common supply-limited conditions. The organic sediment production associated with halophytic vegetation represents a major contributor to the overall deposition flux, thus critically affecting the ability of salt marshes to keep up with high rates of relative sea level rise. The type and number of available equilibria and the possible shifts among them are jointly driven and controlled by the available suspended sediment, the rate of relative sea level change, and vegetation and microphytobenthos colonization. The explicit description of biotic and abiotic processes thus emerges as a key requirement for realistic and predictive models of the evolution of a tidal system as a whole. The analysis of such coupled processes finally indicates that hysteretic switches between stable states arise because of differences in the threshold values of relative sea level rise inducing transitions from vegetated to unvegetated equilibria and vice versa.},

  abstract = {This study presents the validation of a zero-dimensional time-stepping physically based model (MARSED) to simulate the varying rates of long-term (10\textendash{}100 years) tidal marsh accumulation within an estuary. First, field data on long-term tidal marsh accumulation were collected for 25 marsh sites scattered along the Scheldt estuary (NW Europe), based on old topographic data and radiometric and paleoenvironmental dating of sediment cores. The field data showed that estuarine marshes accumulate at highly varying rates depending on (1) the age of the marsh, (2) estuarine variations in mean high water-level (MHWL) rise, and (3) variations in suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs). As a general mechanism, young low marsh surfaces accumulate quickly and asymptotically up to an equilibrium level around MHWL. After this, high old marshes accumulate much slower at rates that are comparable to local MHWL rise. Furthermore, marsh accumulation rates are higher in the inner part than in the outer part of the estuary. This difference can be attributed to the faster MHWL rise and higher SSC values in the inner estuary. Second, the MARSED model was validated against the field data. The model was able to simulate the observed variations in marsh accumulation rates with good accuracy. Furthermore, the model allows to quantify the combined effect of sea-level change and SSC on variations in accumulation rates: they showed that tidal marshes can maintain their equilibrium elevation around MHWL, only if incoming SSC is high enough. Finally, the model allows to predict marsh accumulation rates in response to changing environmental conditions. Simulations for the next 100 years suggest that the tidal marshes in the Scheldt estuary will be able to keep up with the rising MHWL, unless MHWL rise would increase and SSC would decrease importantly.},

  abstract = {Existing numerical models simulating the vertical growth of tidal marshes have only, to a very limited degree, been validated using observed data. In this study, we describe a refined zero-dimensional time-stepping model, which is based on the mass balance approach of Krone [in: Coastal Sediments '87, 1987, pp. 316\textendash{}323], Allen [Mar. Geol. 95 (1990) 77\textendash{}96] and French [Earth Surf. Process. Landforms 18 (1993) 63\textendash{}81]. The model is applied and evaluated, using field data on suspended sediment and tidal regime as input and the historical growth of a specific minerogenic tidal marsh in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) as independent data for model testing. First, the historical rise of the marsh surface during the past 55 years is reconstructed based on land use and vegetation cover changes, which are dated using aerial photographs and which are recognised in sediment cores. After marsh formation, the marsh surface builds up very quickly and asymptotically to an equilibrium level relative to the tidal frame. Second, temporal variations in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were measured above the actual marsh surface during a 1-year period. These measurements show that the SSC, in the water that floods the marsh surface at the beginning of an inundation, increases linearly with maximum inundation height. The application of existing models, which assume a constant incoming SSC, leads to an underestimation of the observed historical growth and to biased predictions under scenarios of future sea-level rise. However, after incorporation of the relationship between SSC and inundation height, the observed vertical growth is successfully simulated. This leads to the conclusion that not only the decrease in tidal inundation, but also the decrease in SSC with decreasing marsh inundation height, is of great importance to fully explain and successfully simulate the long-term vertical morphodynamics of tidal marshes.},
