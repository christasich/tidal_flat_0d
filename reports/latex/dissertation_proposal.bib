We address here lingering concerns that As concentrations in deep tubewells might increase over time with monitoring data spanning a period of up to 5 years for 51 community wells, 115\textendash{}545 ft (34\textendash{}164 m) deep, installed in Araihazar upazila, Bangladesh. This exceptionally detailed data set shows that all but 4 of these community wells have consistently provided drinking water that meets the Bangladesh standard for As in drinking water of 50 {$\mu$}g L- 1; all but 10 community wells have also consistently met the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for As of 10 {$\mu$} g L- 1. Groundwater pumped from one third of the community wells does not meet the current WHO guideline for Mn in drinking water of 0.4 mg L- 1, although Mn concentrations are lower than in most surrounding shallow wells. In addition to As and Mn, concentrations of 10 elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Ba, Hg, Mo, Sb, Pb, and U) out of a total 19 inorganic constituents of potential health concern were monitored and found to be below their respective guideline values established by WHO. Further study is required to evaluate the health consequences of Mn exposure, but the increase in As concentrations in 4 community wells indicates that all deeper tubewells should be periodically re-tested.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To survey tube wells and households in Araihazar upazila, Bangladesh, to set the stage for a long-term epidemiological study of the consequences of chronic arsenic exposure. METHODS: Water samples and household data were collected over a period of 4 months in 2000 from 4997 contiguous tube wells serving a population of 55 000, the position of each well being determined to within {$\pm$} 30 m using Global Positioning System receivers. Arsenic concentrations were determined by graphite-furnace atomic-absorption spectrometry. In addition, groundwater samples collected every 2 weeks for an entire year from six tube wells were analysed for arsenic by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. FINDINGS: Half of the wells surveyed in Araihazar had been installed in the previous 5 years; 94\% were privately owned. Only about 48\% of the surveyed wells supplied water with an arsenic content below 50 mug/l, the current Bangladesh standard for drinking-water. Similar to other regions of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, the distribution of arsenic in Araihazar is spatially highly variable (range: 5-860 mug/l) and therefore difficult to predict. Because of this variability, however, close to 90\% of the inhabitants live within 100 m of a safe well. Monitoring of six tube wells currently meeting the 50 mug/l standard showed no indication of a seasonal cycle in arsenic concentrations coupled to the hydrological cycle. This suggests that well-switching is a viable option in Araihazar, at least for the short term. CONCLUSIONS: Well-switching should be more systematically encouraged in Araihazar and many other parts of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. Social barriers to well-switching need to be better understood and, if possible, overcome.},

  abstract = {Throughout the Holocene, a large sediment load coupled with river avulsions, tectonic activity and eustasy developed the complex stratigraphy of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta. Understanding this development is useful in predicting how the delta will respond to changes in the environmental setting such as climatic shifts and sea-level rise. The complex stratigraphy is also linked to high concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic in the shallow groundwater aquifers of Bangladesh through its controls on hydrogeology and aquifer biogeochemistry. This research investigates differences in the fluvio-deltaic deposits of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, as well as differences in the tectonic setting across the lower delta plain. We investigate how these overarching controls influence stratigraphic architecture, the resulting aquifer systems, and ultimately arsenic distribution within the lower delta plain. A transect of 48 sediment cores spanning the lower delta plain of Bangladesh was drilled to a depth of 90m. Individual samples were analyzed for lithology, provenance and age to determine the stratigraphic architecture, the source of the sediments and the depositional history of the rivers. Delta stratigraphy was related to arsenic distribution by measuring groundwater arsenic near each borehole and combining this data with previously collected groundwater data. This study provides a better understanding of Holocene delta evolution and river behavior, as well as a more complete understanding of the geologic controls on arsenic and the characteristics of contaminant distribution in fluvial settings as they relate to stratigraphic features.},

  title = {Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater in {{Bangladesh}}},
  abstract = {A survey of well waters (n=3534) from throughout Bang- '
ladesh, excluding the Chitt;agong Hill Tracts, has shown
that water from 27\% of the 'shallow' tubewells, that is
wells less than 150 m deep, exceeded the Bangladesh
standard for arsenic in drinking water (50 flg L -I). 46\%
exceeded the WHO guideline value of 10 flg L-I. Figures
for 'deep' wells (greater than 150 m deep) were 1\% and
5\%, respectively. Since it is believed that there are a total of
some 6-11 million tubewells in Bangladesh, mostly
exploiting the depth range 10-50 m, some 1.5-2.5 million
wells are estimated to be contaminated with arsenic
according to the Bangladesh standard. 35 million people
are believed to be exposed to an arsenic concentration in
drinking water exceeding 50 flg L-I and 57 million people
exposed to a concentration exceeding 10 flg L -I.
There is a distinct regional pattern of arsenic contamination
with the greatest contamination in the south and
south-east of the country and the least contamination in
the north-west and in the uplifted areas of north-central
Bangladesh. However, there are occasional arsenic 'hot
spots' in the generally low-arsenic regions of northern
\_Bangladesh. In arsenic-contaminated areas, the large
degree of well-to-well variation within a village means that
it is diffic'ult to predict whether a given well will be contaminated
from tests carried out on neighbouring wells.
The young (Holocene) alluvial and deltaic deposits are
\_\_ m8-s\_caffe\_c.ted\_whereas\_the older alluvial\_sediments in the
,I
tion' hypothesis in which pyrite oxidation in the zone of
water table fluctuation is assumed to release arsenic and
ultimately to be responsible for the groundwater arsenic
problem. There is no evidence to support the proposition
that the groundwater arsenic problem is caused by the
recent seasonal drawdown of the water table due to a
recent increase in irrigation abstraction.
Monitoring of groundwaters at two-weekly intervals at
a number of sites, and at different depths, has shown some
variation with time but there is as yet no convincing evidence
for seasonal changes. Dramatic changes in contamination
are not expected within such a short timescale. A
monitoring programme should be undertaken at a range of
sites to monitor possible long-term changes. In the three
contaminated areas studied in most detail, the arsenic concentration
increases most rapidly between 10-20 m below
ground level.
\textbackslash{}Vhile arsenic is the single greatest problem in Bangladesh
groundwaters, other elements of concern from a
health point of view, are manganese, boron and uranium.
Some 35\% of the groundwaters sampled exceeded the
WHO guideline value for manganese (0.5 mg L-I). The
spatial pattern of the arsenic and manganese problem areas
was significantly different and only 33\% of shallow well
waters complied with the WHO guideline values for both
arsenic and manganese.},

The most intense reduction and so severest pollution is driven by microbial degradation of buried deposits of peat. Concentrations of ammonium up to 23 mg L-1 come from microbial fermentation of buried peat and organic waste in latrines. Concentrations of phosphorus of up to 5 mg L-1 come from the release of sorbed phosphorus when FeOOH is reductively dissolved and from degradation of peat and organic waste from latrines. Calcium and barium in groundwater come from dissolution of detrital (and possibly pedogenic) carbonate, while magnesium is supplied by both carbonate dissolution and weathering of mica.

The As derives from reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxide and release of its sorbed As. The Fe oxyhydroxide exists in the aquifer as dispersed phases, such as coatings on sedimentary grains. Recalculated to pure FeOOH, As concentrations in this phase reach 517 ppm. Reduction of the Fe is driven by microbial metabolism of sedimentary organic matter, which is present in concentrations as high as 6\% C. Arsenic released by oxidation of pyrite, as water levels are drawn down and air enters the aquifer, contributes negligibly to the problem of As pollution. Identification of the mechanism of As release to groundwater helps to provide a framework to guide the placement of new water wells so that they will have acceptable concentrations of As.},

Other factors controlling sediment discharge (e.g., climate, runoff) appear to have secondary importance. A notable exception is the influence of human activity, climate, and geology on the rivers draining southern Asia and Oceania. Sediment fluxes from small mountainous rivers, many of which discharge directly onto active margins (e.g., western South and North America and most high-standing oceanic islands), have been greatly underestimated in previous global sediment budgets, perhaps by as much as a factor of three. In contrast, sediment fluxes to the ocean from large rivers (nearly all of which discharge onto passive margins or marginal seas) have been overestimated, as some of the sediment load is subaerially sequestered in subsiding deltas. Before the proliferation of dam construction in the latter half of this century, rivers probably discharged about 20 billion tons of sediment annually to the ocean. Prior to widespread farming and deforestation (beginning 2000-2500 yr ago), however, sediment discharge probably was less than half the present level. Sediments discharged by small mountainous rivers are more likely to escape to the deep sea during high stands of sea level by virtue of a greater impact of episodic events (i.e., flash floods and earthquakes) on small drainage basins and because of the narrow shelves associated with active margins. The resulting delta/fan deposits can be distinctly different than the sedimentary deposits derived from larger rivers that discharge onto passive margins.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The landscape of southwest Bangladesh, a region constructed primarily by fluvial processes associated with the Ganges River and Brahmaputra River, is now maintained almost exclusively by tidal processes as the fluvial system has migrated east and eliminated the most direct fluvial input. In natural areas such as the Sundarbans National Forest, year-round inundation during spring high tides delivers sufficient sediment that enables vertical accretion to keep pace with relative sea-level rise. However, recent human modification of the landscape in the form of embankment construction has terminated this pathway of sediment delivery for much of the region, resulting in a startling elevation imbalance, with inhabited areas often sitting \&gt;1\&thinsp;m below mean high water. Restoring this landscape, or preventing land loss in the natural system, requires an understanding of how rates of water and sediment flux vary across timescales ranging from hours to months. In this study, we combine time series observations of water level, salinity, and suspended sediment concentration with ship-based measurements of large tidal-channel hydrodynamics and sediment transport. To capture the greatest possible range of variability, cross-channel transects designed to encompass a 12.4\&thinsp;h tidal cycle were performed in both dry and wet seasons during spring and neap tides.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Regional suspended sediment concentration begins to increase in August, coincident with a decrease in local salinity, indicating the arrival of the sediment-laden, freshwater plume of the combined Ganges\textendash{}Brahmaputra\textendash{}Meghna rivers. We observe profound seasonality in sediment transport, despite comparatively modest seasonal variability in the magnitude of water discharge. These observations emphasize the importance of seasonal sediment delivery from the main-stem rivers to this remote tidal region. On tidal timescales, spring tides transport an order of magnitude more sediment than neap tides in both the wet and dry seasons. In aggregate, sediment transport is flood oriented, likely as a result of tidal pumping. Finally, we note that rates of sediment and water discharge in the tidal channels are of the same scale as the annually averaged values for the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. These observations provide context for examining the relative importance of fluvial and tidal processes in what has been defined as a quintessentially tidally influenced delta in the classification scheme of Galloway (1975). These data also inform critical questions regarding the timing and magnitude of sediment delivery to the region, which are especially important in predicting and preparing for responses of the natural system to ongoing environmental change.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Numerical modelling is one way to improve understanding of the growth and response to external factors of high tidal mudflats and marshes. Theoretically, mudflat-marsh growth is determined by the rates of minerogenic and organogenic sedimentation, the rate of change and tendency of relative sea-level, and the rate of ``long-range'' sediment compaction. A numerical simulation model for mudflat-marsh growth using these ideas is described and implemented for the Severn Estuary on the basis of empirical knowledge of its tidal and fine-sediment regimes and of the present-day order of magnitude of the deposition rate of fine sediment in its upper intertidal zone. The predicted curve of vertical growth relative to the tidal frame at first rises very steeply but thereafter flattens rapidly. Its precise form depends on the balance between the terms of the governing equation. When relative sea-level is rising, a marsh may grow, after a certain maturation time, to a stable elevation in the moving tidal frame that is substantially less than the elevation of the extreme tide, a situation that could inhibit peat formation. When the tendency of relative sea-level is downward, or when the rate of organogenic sedimentation is sufficiently large, a marsh after a certain emergence time may rise above the tidal frame, with the consequence that peat growth is favoured. The exploratory model is supported by a published growth curve for tidal marshes in eastern England, and by the observed internal stratification and relative elevations of the salt marshes developed along the Severn Estuary.},

  abstract = {In parts of North America and Europe, present and future sedimentary deficits translate into major areal losses of coastal salt marsh. Physically based simulations of medium- to long-term adjustment to accelerated sea-level rise are few, partly due to the difficulty in extrapolating imperfectly understood sedimentation parameters. This paper outlines the implementation and application of a simple one-dimensional mass balance model designed to simulate the vertical adjustment of predominantly minerogenic marsh surfaces to various combinations of sediment supply, tidal levels and regional subsidence. Two aspects of marsh growth are examined, with reference to sites on the macro-tidal north Norfolk coast, U.K.: (i) historical marsh growth under a scenario of effective (long-term) eustatic stability but slow regional subsidence; and (ii) marsh response to various non-linear eustatic rise scenarios for the next century. In contrast to more organogenic North American marshes, sedimentation rates in Norfolk are strongly time-dependent. Where the overall sediment budget is so closely linked to marsh age and relative elevation, some form of numerical simulation offers a preferred means of predicting the impact of accelerated sea-level rise. Simulations performed here show that only the most dramatic eustatic scenarios result in ecological `drowning' and reversion to tidal flat within the conventional 2100 prediction interval. Currently favoured scenarios give rise to accretionary deficits which are clearly sustainable in the short-term, albeit at the expense of increased inundation frequency and consequent changes in the distribution of marsh flora and fauna.},

Here, we report that islands in southwest Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments in the 1960s, have lost 1.0\textendash{}1.5 m of elevation, whereas the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove forest has remained comparatively stable6,7,8. We attribute this elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation inside the embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest biomass, and a regionally increased tidal range. One major consequence of this elevation loss occurred in 2009 when the embankments of several large islands failed during Cyclone Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up to two years until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suffering during this time9,10, the newly reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres of tidally deposited sediment, equivalent to decades' worth of normal sedimentation. Although many areas still lie well below mean high water and remain at risk of severe flooding, we conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled embankment breaches.},

In this study, we describe a refined zero-dimensional time-stepping model, which is based on the mass balance approach of Krone [in: Coastal Sediments '87, 1987, pp. 316\textendash{}323], Allen [Mar. Geol. 95 (1990) 77\textendash{}96] and French [Earth Surf. Process. Landforms 18 (1993) 63\textendash{}81]. The model is applied and evaluated, using field data on suspended sediment and tidal regime as input and the historical growth of a specific minerogenic tidal marsh in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) as independent data for model testing. First, the historical rise of the marsh surface during the past 55 years is reconstructed based on land use and vegetation cover changes, which are dated using aerial photographs and which are recognised in sediment cores. After marsh formation, the marsh surface builds up very quickly and asymptotically to an equilibrium level relative to the tidal frame. Second, temporal variations in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were measured above the actual marsh surface during a 1-year period. These measurements show that the SSC, in the water that floods the marsh surface at the beginning of an inundation, increases linearly with maximum inundation height. The application of existing models, which assume a constant incoming SSC, leads to an underestimation of the observed historical growth and to biased predictions under scenarios of future sea-level rise. However, after incorporation of the relationship between SSC and inundation height, the observed vertical growth is successfully simulated. This leads to the conclusion that not only the decrease in tidal inundation, but also the decrease in SSC with decreasing marsh inundation height, is of great importance to fully explain and successfully simulate the long-term vertical morphodynamics of tidal marshes.},

  abstract = {This study presents the validation of a zero-dimensional time-stepping physically based model (MARSED) to simulate the varying rates of long-term (10\textendash{}100 years) tidal marsh accumulation within an estuary. First, field data on long-term tidal marsh accumulation were collected for 25 marsh sites scattered along the Scheldt estuary (NW Europe), based on old topographic data and radiometric and paleoenvironmental dating of sediment cores. The field data showed that estuarine marshes accumulate at highly varying rates depending on (1) the age of the marsh, (2) estuarine variations in mean high water-level (MHWL) rise, and (3) variations in suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs). As a general mechanism, young low marsh surfaces accumulate quickly and asymptotically up to an equilibrium level around MHWL. After this, high old marshes accumulate much slower at rates that are comparable to local MHWL rise. Furthermore, marsh accumulation rates are higher in the inner part than in the outer part of the estuary. This difference can be attributed to the faster MHWL rise and higher SSC values in the inner estuary. Second, the MARSED model was validated against the field data. The model was able to simulate the observed variations in marsh accumulation rates with good accuracy. Furthermore, the model allows to quantify the combined effect of sea-level change and SSC on variations in accumulation rates: they showed that tidal marshes can maintain their equilibrium elevation around MHWL, only if incoming SSC is high enough. Finally, the model allows to predict marsh accumulation rates in response to changing environmental conditions. Simulations for the next 100 years suggest that the tidal marshes in the Scheldt estuary will be able to keep up with the rising MHWL, unless MHWL rise would increase and SSC would decrease importantly.},

In order to address these challenges, local people have identified `tidal river management (TRM)' as a comprehensive approach for sustainably managing this part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin. However, due to institutional limitations, mismanagement and social conflicts, application of the TRM approach is not straightforward. In order to identify existing implementation barriers and to effectively apply the TRM approach, a transdisciplinary approach is examined for its potential to inform the re-shaping of TRM governing values and actions. It is argued that a thorough application of a transdisciplinary framework is essential, supported by the active involvement of key agencies and local stakeholders. The proposed transdisciplinary framework can potentially be applied to TRM projects for solving waterlogging and associated problems in order to achieve greater sustainability of the area.},

  abstract = {Evidence is presented from three estuarine tide gauges located in the Sundarban area of southwest Bangladesh of relative sea level rise substantially in excess of the generally accepted rates from altimetry, as well as previous tide-gauge analyses. It is proposed that the difference arises from the use of Relative Mean Sea Level (RMSL) to characterise the present and future coastal flood hazard, since RMSL can be misleading in estuaries in which tidal range is changing. Three tide gauges, one located in the uninhabited mangrove forested area (Sundarban) of southwest Bangladesh, the others in the densely populated polder zone north of the present Sundarban, show rates of increase in RMSL ranging from 2.8mma-1 to 8.8mma-1. However, these trends in RMSL disguise the fact that high water levels in the polder zone have been increasing at an average rate of 15.9mma-1 and a maximum of 17.2mma-1. In an area experiencing tidal range amplification, RMSL will always underestimate the rise in high water levels; consequently, as an alternative to RMSL, the use of trends in high water maxima or `Effective Sea Level Rise' (ESLR) is adopted as a more strategic parameter to characterise the flooding hazard potential. The rate of increase in ESLR is shown to be due to a combination of deltaic subsidence, including sediment compaction, and eustatic sea level rise, but principally as a result of increased tidal range in estuary channels recently constricted by embankments. These increases in ESLR have been partially offset by decreases in fresh water discharge in those estuaries connected to the Ganges. The recognition of increases of the effective sea level in the Bangladesh Sundarban, which are substantially greater than increases in mean sea level, is of the utmost importance to flood management in this low-lying and densely populated area.},

  abstract = {Riverbed siltation along with back water effect due to sea-level rise and high tide is leading to prolonged water-logging in south-west Bangladesh in recent two to three decades. Gradual siltation is the main source of the problem on the riverbed triggered by inadequate runoffs in the southern reaches caused by the polders constructed under the Coastal Embankment Project (CEP) during the sixties. The consequent losses in agricultural production due to the inundation of about 128 thousand hectare crop land were noticed in Jessore, Satkhira and Khulna districts that directly affects the life and livelihood of about one million people. Continuous climate change would put extra burdens on the social and economic challenges that the poorest already face, emphasizing and increasing their vulnerabilities due to the dependence of their livelihoods on climate sensitive natural resources and their weak social protection structures. For removing water logging effect, plinth rising and elevating the local habitats and physical infrastructures can be considered as an immediate and short-term measure whereas operation of Tidal River Management (TRM) technology might be considered for long-term or permanent solution for raising the low lands or beels. The dead or silted-up rivers, canals, ponds and irrigation channels can be excavated or re-excavated by operating the major workfare social safety net programmes of the government like Food-for-Work (FFW) or Cash-for-Work (CFW) and the excavated soil can be utilized for creating, maintaining or raising the rural roads, polder/embankment and related other infrastructures which are quite crucial for mitigating the flood or water logging problem in the region. For continuing crop production local people are engaged in floating agriculture, crop production with Sorjan method, and fish cultivation in lowland to utilize the water-logged land around the southern region. They elevate and widen the surroundings of that waterlogged land utilized for vegetable and fruit production. Such local practices can properly be screened and piloted befitting to climate change adaptation to the water congestion areas of the country. The interventions may also be applicable to other agro-climatic regions or countries suffering from the similar problem.},

Further, the availability of freshwater is highly seasonal depending on the presence and duration of the monsoon. The incidence of both flood and drought in a yearly cycle profoundly affects river morphology. This paper identifies various geographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors that shape the water management issues of Bangladesh. The paper mainly concerns the status and trend of these issues.},

While donor requirements for community participation in water projects have resulted in the creation of `depoliticized' water management organizations, there are now increasing demands for involvement of politically elected local government institutions in water management by local communities.},

  abstract = {The variation of river flow within a natural range plays an important role in promoting the social-ecological sustainability of a river basin. In order to determine the extent of the natural range of variation, this study assesses hydrologic flow thresholds for the Lower Ganges River Basin. The flow threshold was calculated using twenty-two ``Range of Variability (RVA)'' parameters. The impact of Farakka Dam on the Lower Ganges River flow was calculated by comparing threshold parameters for the pre-Farakka period (from 1934 to 1974) and the post-Farakka period (1975\textendash{}2005). The results demonstrate that due to water diversion by the Farakka Dam, various threshold parameters, including the monthly mean of the dry season (December\textendash{}May) and yearly minimum flows, have been altered significantly. The ecological consequences of such hydrologic alterations include the destruction of the breeding and raising grounds for a number of Gangetic species, the increase of salinity in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh and a reduction of fish and agricultural diversity. The major findings in this paper have a number of policy-level implications to aid water sharing mechanisms and agreements between the government of Bangladesh and India. The methodological approach presented in this study is applicable to other river basins.},

It has been argued that dealing with delta floods in this region boils down to adopting either open or closed approaches. This paper longitudinally structures the open-or-closed debate based on a number of emblematic water management projects in the region. Departing from a typical open wetland history, river and polder embankments increasingly started to constrain flood dynamics. Upheaval among rural populations in response to the negative impacts of hydraulic engineering plans and works coalesced in efforts to restore open approaches, synthesized in the Tidal River Management concept. Its resemblance to historic overflow irrigation is often used politically as a yardstick to challenge the dominant hydraulic engineering paradigm. This paper argues that dealing with floods in Bangladesh requires plans, policies and projects formulated against the historic background of complex interactions among social processes, environmental dynamics and technological interventions: a lesson to be incorporated in on-going policy-making processes and long-term delta management plans.},

  shorttitle = {Sustainability Impacts of Tidal River Management},
  abstract = {The Southwest Coastal people of Bangladesh have introduced Tidal River Management (TRM) as an environmentally acceptable water resource management practice based on their indigenous knowledge of water logging of low lying coastal land. TRM helps to address problems resulting from different anthropogenic and structural development activities, and it has been successful in helping coastal communities to adapt to climate change and rising sea level vulnerability by forming new land in Tidal Basins. Hence, it is essential to measure sustainability impacts of TRM from the environmental, socio-economic and institutional perspectives. Therefore, firstly, the study identifies sustainability indicators of TRM considering ecosystem services and secondly, develops an inclusive conceptual framework to understand the important impacts of each indicator at various spatial and temporal scales. The conceptual framework is followed by the construction of a Sustainability Index of Tidal River Management (SITRM). It has advantages over the Ramsar Convention framework (2007) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) framework (2012) to measure water sustainability as it includes a sustainable model to project future vulnerability of the community, river and Tidal Basin, emphasizing on climate change issues. It also involves trade-offs analysis, livelihood analysis and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis for a complete impact assessment to enable decision-makers to focus on those services most likely to be of risks and weaknesses or opportunities and strengths for the sustainability of TRM. Moreover, the framework is a useful guide for policymakers in identifying the sustainability impacts of TRM so that they can choose best coping strategies for coastal people to effectively deal with adverse effects of water-logging and undesired climatic events as well as environmental and socio-economic changes in coastal areas.},

Prolonged shrimp farming for 5-, 10-, and 15-year period has increased soil salinity, acidity, and depleted soil Ca, K, Mg, and organic C content of all three types of soils in the villages to a variable degree and caused soil degradation that significantly affected the rice yield.

However, which research method or approach is best suited to a particular inquiry is frequently debated and discussed. Working Together examines how different methods have promoted various theoretical developments related to collective action and the commons, and demonstrates the importance of cross-fertilization involving multimethod research across traditional boundaries. The authors look at why cross-fertilization is difficult to achieve, and they show ways to overcome these challenges through collaboration. The authors provide numerous examples of collaborative, multimethod research related to collective action and the commons. They examine the pros and cons of case studies, meta-analyses, large-N field research, experiments and modeling, and empirically grounded agent-based models, and they consider how these methods contribute to research on collective action for the management of natural resources. Using their findings, the authors outline a revised theory of collective action that includes three elements: individual decision making, microsituational conditions, and features of the broader social-ecological context. Acknowledging the academic incentives that influence and constrain how research is conducted, Working Together reworks the theory of collective action and offers practical solutions for researchers and students across a spectrum of disciplines.},

  isbn = {978-94-017-1053-4},
  abstract = {Bangladesh is frequently visited by natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, storm surges, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and ``norwesters.'' Of these, tropical cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and associated storm surges are the most disastrous. There are various reasons for the disastrous effects of cyclones and storm surges in Bangladesh. Superimposed on these disastrous effects, climate change and any consequent sea level rise are likely to add fuel to the fire. Arise in temperature is likely to change cyclone activity: cyclone intensity, if not cyclone frequency, may increase. As a result, storm surges may also increase substantially. Sea level rise, an increase in cyclone intensity, and consequent increases in storm surge heights will have disastrous effects on a deltaic country like Bangladesh, which is not much above the mean sea level. This paper examines the climatology of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal for the last 110 years and trends in cyclone frequency and intensity. The phenomenon of storm surges in the Bay of Bengal is examined along with the primary reasons for the severity of storm surges in Bangladesh. The paper discusses both qualitatively and quantitatively the impacts of rises in temperature on tropical cyclone intensity in Bangladesh. With the use of a mathematical model developed for the simulation of storm surges along the Bangladesh coast, various scenarios of storm surges are developed. Using lower and upper bounds of sea surface temperature rise of 2 and 4\textdegree{}C and of sea level rise of 0.3 and 1.0 m (according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change standard), the model simulates the maximum possible surges that are likely to occur under these conditions.},

Assuming no responses, the following major impacts were identified. (1) Area Inundation: Over 25,000 km{$^2$} ({$>$}17.5\% of the existing land area could be inundated (lie beneath high tide). This includes 85 cities and towns, one major port (Mongla), over 800 km of roads and 28 km of railways.

(3) Ecosystem Destruction: Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest (5,770 km{$^2$}) is threatened with inundation and hence total destruction, including the world-famous Royal Bengal Tiger. (4) Agricultural Losses: Over 1.2 million ha of breadbasket land, producing 16\% of the country's rice, could be lost due to inundation. To provide minimum protection against a one-meter rise in sea level (protection against a 20-year flood), Bangladesh will have to upgrade 4,800 km of existing embankments and build 4,000 km of new embankments. This will cost over one billion U.S. dollars at 1989 prices. Natural sedimentation and the resulting vertical accretion it produces is not considered. Sea-level rise will also interact with river flow and cyclones to increase the already severe problems of flooding in Bangladesh. Therefore, sea-level rise, in specific, and global climate change in general, is of great concern to Bangladesh.]},

Results demonstrate that splay size does not always scale directly with channel size or discharge and that hydrodynamic factors\textemdash{}primarily sediment size and floodplain-drainage conditions\textemdash{}play a significant role in determining whether a fluvial system is likely to produce large, floodplain-filling splays. This work suggests that widespread crevasse splays demand both a large supply of relatively coarse suspended sediment and a steep water-surface slope away from the channel across the floodplain. Without both these conditions, the role of crevasse splays in flood-basin filling is limited.},

  abstract = {Scale issues have significant implications for the analysis of social and biophysical processes in complex systems. These same scale implications are likewise considerations for the design and application of models of landcover change. Scale issues have wide-ranging effects from the representativeness of data used to validate models to aggregation errors introduced in the model structure. This paper presents an analysis of how scale issues affect an agent-based model (ABM) of landcover change developed for a research area in the Midwest, USA. The research presented here explores how scale factors affect the design and application of agent-based landcover change models. The ABM is composed of a series of heterogeneous agents who make landuse decisions on a portfolio of cells in a raster-based programming environment. The model is calibrated using measures of fit derived from both spatial composition and spatial pattern metrics from multi-temporal landcover data interpreted from historical aerial photography. A model calibration process is used to find a best-fit set of parameter weights assigned to agents' preferences for different landuses (agriculture, pasture, timber production, and non-harvested forest). Previous research using this model has shown how a heterogeneous set of agents with differing preferences for a portfolio of landuses produces the best fit to landcover changes observed in the study area. The scale dependence of the model is explored by varying the resolution of the input data used to calibrate the model (observed landcover), ancillary datasets that affect land suitability (topography), and the resolution of the model landscape on which agents make decisions. To explore the impact of these scale relationships the model is run with input datasets constructed at the following spatial resolutions: 60, 90, 120, 150, 240, 300 and 480 m. The results show that the distribution of landuse-preference weights differs as a function of scale. In addition, with the gradient descent model fitting method used in this analysis the model was not able to converge to an acceptable fit at the 300 and 480 m spatial resolutions. This is a product of the ratio of the input cell resolution to the average parcel size in the landscape. This paper uses these findings to identify scale considerations in the design, development, validation and application of ABMs of landcover change.},

Interactions between human stakeholders are represented using multi-agent models that act on forest landscape models in the form of land-use change. Feedback on the effects of these actions is received through ecological habitat metrics and hydrological responses. Results are presented on the dynamics of land-use change under different growth management strategies based on an area of the Dallas\textendash{}Fort Worth (Texas, U.S.A.) region facing intense residential development.},

Humans play a critical role in affecting such systems and in giving rise to various environmental consequences, which may in turn affect future human decisions and behavior. In light of complexity theory and its application in CHANS, this paper reviews various decision models used in agent based simulations of CHANS dynamics, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. This paper concludes by advocating development of more process-based decision models as well as protocols or architectures that facilitate better modeling of human decisions in various CHANS.},

Optimal actions differ among some objective functions and parameter values, especially for land tenants, whose enterprise allocation is less constrained by rotations. Our results demonstrate in a nonlaboratory decision context that psychologically plausible deviations from EU maximization matter.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised seismic facies analysis provides an effective way to estimate reservoir properties by combining different seismic attributes through pattern recognition algorithms. However, without consistent geological information, parameters such as the number of facies and even the input seismic attributes are usually chosen in an empirical way. In this context, we propose two new semiautomatic alternative methods. In the first one, we use the clustering of the Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a new way to build seismic facies maps and to estimate the number of seismic facies. In the second method, we use wavelet transforms to identify seismic trace singularities in each geologically oriented segment, and then we build the seismic facies map using the clustering of the SOM. We tested both methods using synthetic and real seismic data from the Namorado deepwater giant oilfield in Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. The results confirm that we can estimate the appropriate number of seismic facies through the clustering of the SOM. We also showed that we can improve the seismic facies analysis by using trace singularities detected by the wavelet transform technique. This workflow presents the advantage of being less sensitive to horizon interpretation errors, thus resulting in an improved seismic facies analysis.},

  abstract = {Pattern recognition-based seismic facies analysis techniques are commonly used in modern quantitative seismic interpretation. However, interpreters often treat techniques such as artificial neural networks and self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a ``black box'' that somehow correlates a suite of attributes to a desired geomorphological or geomechanical facies. Even when the statistical correlations are good, the inability to explain such correlations through principles of geology or physics results in suspicion of the results. The most common multiattribute facies analysis begins by correlating a suite of candidate attributes to a desired output, keeping those that correlate best for subsequent analysis. The analysis then takes place in attribute space rather than (xx{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}x{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, yy{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}y{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, and zz{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}z{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}) space, removing spatial trends often observed by interpreters. We add a stratigraphy layering component to a SOM model that attempts to preserve the intersample relation along the vertical axis. Specifically, we use a mode decomposition algorithm to capture the sedimentary cycle pattern as an ``attribute.'' If we correlate this attribute to the training data, it will favor SOM facies maps that follow stratigraphy. We apply this workflow to a Barnett Shale data set and find that the constrained SOM facies map shows layers that are easily overlooked on traditional unconstrained SOM facies map.},
