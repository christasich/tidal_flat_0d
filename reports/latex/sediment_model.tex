	\subsection*{Field observations and model parameters}
	
	We observed tidal height, grain size, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and dry bulk density over multiple field seasons (both dry and monsoon) from 2011-2016. The tidal height, measured above the platform, was inferred from a pressure sensor deployed at Polder 32 [INCLUDE LOC]. The median grain size was measured in multiple locations around Polder 32 and within the natural mangrove forest. Grain sizes ranged from 14-27 Âµm, which is consistent with medium to coarse silt. SSCs were obtained using an optical backscatter point sensor (OBS) affixed to the side of small boat. SSC varied within a tidal cycle (0-3 g/L) and seasonally (0.15-0.77 g/L). Dry bulk density (900-1500 kg/m\textsuperscript{3}) was determined from sediment samples at depths of 50-100 cm \cite{auerbachFloodRiskNatural2015}. These field observations were used to define distributions for each model parameter 
	
	
	\subsection*{Numerical model}
		
	We modeled tidal platform elevation (\(\zeta\)) at a point through time as 	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
	\frac{d \zeta}{d t} = \frac{d S_M}{d t} + \frac{d S_O}{d t} + \frac{d P}{d t} + \frac{d M}{d t},
	\end{equation}
	where (\S_M\) is mineral sedimentation, (\S_O\) is organic matter sedimentation, $P$ is compaction, and $M$ is tectonic subsidence \cite{frenchNumericalSimulationVertical1993,temmermanModellingLongtermTidal2003,temmermanModellingEstuarineVariations2004}.
	
	We approximate $S_M$ as
	\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
	S_M(t) = \int{\frac{w_{s}C(t)}{\rho}dt},
	\end{equation}
	where $w_s$ is the characteristic settling velocity of a grain given by Stokes' law, $C$ is the depth-averaged suspended sediment concentration in the water column, and $\rho$ is the dry bulk density of the sediment. Equation \ref{eq2} assumes there is no resuspension of mineral sediment \cite{kroneMethodSimulatingMarsh1987}.
	
	We capture the temporal variation of suspended sediment concentrations during one tidal cycle through the mass balance given as
	\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
	\frac{d[h(t)-\zeta]C(t)}{dt} = -w_sC(t)+C_{in}\frac{dh}{dt},
	\end{equation}
	where $h$ is the height of the water column and $C_{in}$ is the incoming suspended sediment concentration of the adjacent water column \cite{kroneMethodSimulatingMarsh1987,frenchNumericalSimulationVertical1993,temmermanModellingLongtermTidal2003,temmermanModellingEstuarineVariations2004}.
	
	The incoming suspended sediment concentration also varies with time and can be written as
	\begin{equation}\label{eq4}
	C_{in}(t) = C_{max}[h(t)-\zeta],
	\end{equation}
	where \(C_{max}\) is the maximum suspended sediment concentration of the adjacent water column.
