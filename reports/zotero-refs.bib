	abstract = {The ocean is a sink for {\textasciitilde}25\% of the atmospheric {CO}2 emitted by human activities, an amount in excess of 2 petagrams of carbon per year ({PgC} yr−1). Time-resolved estimates of global ocean-atmosphere {CO}2 flux provide an important constraint on the global carbon budget. However, previous estimates of this flux, derived from surface ocean {CO}2 concentrations, have not corrected the data for temperature gradients between the surface and sampling at a few meters depth, or for the effect of the cool ocean surface skin. Here we calculate a time history of ocean-atmosphere {CO}2 fluxes from 1992 to 2018, corrected for these effects. These increase the calculated net flux into the oceans by 0.8–0.9  {PgC} yr−1, at times doubling uncorrected values. We estimate uncertainties using multiple interpolation methods, finding convergent results for fluxes globally after 2000, or over the Northern Hemisphere throughout the period. Our corrections reconcile surface uptake with independent estimates of the increase in ocean {CO}2 inventory, and suggest most ocean models underestimate uptake.},

	abstract = {As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129–116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 {CE}), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 ({HadCM}3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R ({GISS}), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 ({CCSM}) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 ({RCP}8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 {CE}, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 {CE}, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under {RCP}4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 {CE}. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in {RCP}4.5 ({\textless}1\%) but reach 8.7\% of the globe under {RCP}8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, {RCP}4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as {RCP}8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity.},

This hypothesis, however, neglects potential changes in the strengths of atmospheric circulations associated with precipitation extremes. As increased moisture leads to increased precipitation, the increased latent heating may lead to stronger large-scale ascent and thus, additional increase in precipitation, leading to a super-{CC} scaling. This study investigates this possibility in the context of the 2015 Texas extreme precipitation event using the Column Quasi-Geostrophic ({CQG}) method. Analogs to this event are simulated in different climatic conditions with varying surface temperature (

	abstract = {In the Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) delta, periodic flooding of the land surface during the tidal cycle coupled with enormous sediment delivery during the monsoon promotes sediment accretion and surface elevation gain through time. However, over the past several decades, widespread embankment (“polder”) construction in the G-B tidal delta plain has led to numerous environmental disturbances, including channel siltation and tide range amplification. While previous research indicates that rates of sediment accretion are relatively high in the G-B tidal delta plain, it remains unclear if and how surface elevation is maintaining pace with relative sea-level rise ({RSLR}) in this region. In this study, we utilize an array of surface elevation tables, sediment traps, and groundwater piezometers to provide longitudinal trends of sedimentation and elevation dynamics with respect to local platform elevation and associated hydroperiod. Two hydro-geomorphic settings of the Sundarbans mangrove forest are compared: higher elevation stream-bank and lower elevation interior. Seasonal measurements over a time span of 5 years reveal that elevation gain is occurring in all settings, with the highest rates observed at elevated stream-bank zones. Elevation gain occurs primarily in response to sediment accretion, with possible minor contributions from pore-water storage and swelling of clay minerals during the monsoon season (i.e., belowground biomass and organic contribution is minimal). As a result, elevation loss and shallow subsidence in the G-B delta is unlikely to be caused by compaction of organic-rich soils, but rather appears to be controlled by seasonal lowering of the groundwater table and compaction of clay minerals. Rates of surface elevation gain in the Sundarbans greatly exceed rates of {RSLR} and more closely follow rates of {RSLR} augmented from tide range amplification, indicating that this landscape is adapting to human-induced environmental change. The proceedings of this study underscore the adaptability of the natural G-B tidal delta plain to local environmental disturbances, with the caveat that these defenses may be lost to future upstream reductions in sediment supply.},

	abstract = {Existing adaptation planning processes are inadequate to address the impacts of flooding. The goal of the study is to design adaptation pathways for enhancing livelihood resilience of flood-affected households in Bangladesh—one of the most flood-vulnerable countries in the world. We developed adaptation pathways by using three sequential steps: (1) assessing livelihood resilience by constructing resilience indices; (2) determining adaptation options by employing principal component analysis ({PCA}) of resilience indicators; and (3) designing pathways of selected adaptation options by conducting key informant interviews ({KIIs}), and participatory workshops. Livelihood resilience was assessed based on an established framework that builds on 18 indicators representing three capacities (absorptive, adaptive and transformative) and six dimensions: social, institutional, economic, ecological, physical, and political. Using a structured questionnaire survey, we collected data from 360 households of 18 villages of 9 sub-districts in Bangladesh. Results revealed that about onethird of total households had capacities to reduce flood shocks and stresses and improve livelihood opportunities. Following a resilience assessment, we conducted {PCA} for determining adaptation options, namely learning, infrastructure, and governance. Through {KIIs} and stakeholder engagement workshops, pathways of selected adaptation options were designed. The adaptation pathways entail short-, medium-, and long-term adaptation options, which contribute to maintaining persistence, leading to the transition, and facilitating transformation. Essential issues of implementation of adaptation pathways were determined. Critical policy implications around strengthening governance, promoting economy, and managing technologies were outlined.},

Each simulation covers the period from 1970 through 2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways ({RCP}2.6 and {RCP}8.5). Regional climate simulations exhibit high fidelity in capturing key characteristics of precipitation and atmospheric dynamics across monsoon regions in the historical period. In the future period, regional monsoons exhibit a spatially robust delay in the monsoon onset, an increase in seasonality, and a reduction in the rainy season length at higher levels of radiative forcing. All regions with substantial delays in the monsoon onset exhibit a decrease in pre-monsoon precipitation, indicating a strong connection between pre-monsoon drying and a shift in the monsoon onset. The weakening of latent heat driven atmospheric warming during the pre-monsoon period delays the overturning of atmospheric subsidence in the monsoon regions, which defers their transitioning into deep convective states. Monsoon changes under the {RCP}2.6 scenario are mostly within the baseline variability.},

	abstract = {Southwest Bangladesh, located on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, is experiencing the impacts of sea level rise ({SLR}) due to processes at both the local and global scale. In particular, regional alterations of the hydrodynamic network, due to embankment construction, have drastically altered effective {SLR}, placing millions of inhabitants at risk of prolonged inundation, and threatening the world’s largest continuous mangrove stand, the Sundarbans National Forest ({SNF}). In order to effectively employ landscape recovery solutions, an understanding of local sediment transport and deposition is critical. This ﬁeld-based study investigates the sediment dynamics between the mangrove platform and tidal channels of the {SNF} using data from a variety of instruments and sediment samples collected within a forested subbasin (∼20 km2) fed by a major tidal channel. We observe profound seasonal variability within the sub-basin, with the wet season exhibiting a deeper and longer inundation of the mangrove platform and greater suspended sediment concentrations ({SSC}). Further, there exists a trend of decreasing {SSC} and median grain size from the perimeter of the {SNF} to the interior, and decreasing {SSC} from the tidal channel to the platform at both locations. We project seasonal platform sedimentation rates ranging from 0.17 ± 0.16 cm in the dry season to 1.8 ± 0.35 cm in the wet season. Importantly, the annual deposition rate measured at either location is sufﬁciently rapid to keep pace with observed rates of effective {SLR} published in other studies (∼1.0–1.7 cm/year). Based on our results, it appears that many controls on sedimentation are both covariant and of similar importance to land aggradation in the {SNF}. While inundation depth and frequency will likely increase under future {SLR} scenarios, sediment supply is threatened by India’s proposed River Linking Project, which could decrease the sediment loads of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers by as much as 75 and 25\%, respectively. These rivers provide the sediment for the entire delta, and we predict that with decreasing {SSC}, some regions—particularly interior sediment-depleted regions—may begin to deteriorate and become submerged, including within the {SNF}.},

	abstract = {Annual sediment delivery by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers to the Bengal margin has kept pace with sea level rise since the mid Holocene, sustaining subaerial growth of the delta. However, the Sundarbans region of the tidal delta is disconnected from major distributary sources of sediment and is often thought to be sediment starved, eroding, and susceptible to the meter of sea level rise predicted for the 21st century. Despite these assumptions, direct sedimentation measurements on the tidal delta plain reveal widespread mean annualized accretion rates of ∼1.1 cm yr−1, although heterogeneous depositional patterns indicate that topography and internal creek networks influence local sediment distribution. Short-lived radioisotope inventories (7Be: t1/2 = 53.3 days) measured on the freshly accumulated sediments indicate that about ½ of the mass deposited on the lower delta was sourced directly from the seasonal flood pulse of the river; the remaining ½ is derived from older (≥1 yr) reworked sediments. Net sedimentation on this part of the delta traps ∼10\% of annual Ganges–Brahmaputra sediment load, with accretion rates roughly equivalent to the mean regional rate of relative sea-level rise ({RSLR}) of ∼1.0 cm yr−1. If these sedimentation rates are representative of longer-term trends and subsidence rates remain stable over the next century, the lower delta plain may continue to maintain its elevation and stability despite documented mangrove retreat around its seaward edges.},

Failure to recognise this has led to serious misconceptions about the potential impacts of a rising sea-level on Bangladesh with global warming. This situation has been aggravated by accounts giving incorrect information on current rates of coastal erosion and land subsidence. This paper describes physical conditions within individual physiographic regions in Bangladesh’s coastal area based on ground-surveyed information, and it reviews possible area-specific mitigation measures to counter predicted rates of sea-level rise in the 21st century. Two important conclusions are drawn: the adoption of appropriate measures based on knowledge of the physical geography of potentially-affected areas could significantly reduce the currently-predicted displacement of many millions of people; and the impacts of a slowly-rising sea-level are currently much less than those generated by rapidly increasing population pressure on Bangladesh’s available land and water resources and by exposure to existing environmental hazards, and the latter problems need priority attention.},

	abstract = {In the Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) delta, periodic flooding of the land surface during the tidal cycle coupled with enormous sediment delivery during the monsoon promotes sediment accretion and surface elevation gain through time. However, over the past several decades, widespread embankment (“polder”) construction in the G-B tidal delta plain has led to numerous environmental disturbances, including channel siltation and tide range amplification. While previous research indicates that rates of sediment accretion are relatively high in the G-B tidal delta plain, it remains unclear if and how surface elevation is maintaining pace with relative sea-level rise ({RSLR}) in this region. In this study, we utilize an array of surface elevation tables, sediment traps, and groundwater piezometers to provide longitudinal trends of sedimentation and elevation dynamics with respect to local platform elevation and associated hydroperiod. Two hydro-geomorphic settings of the Sundarbans mangrove forest are compared: higher elevation stream-bank and lower elevation interior. Seasonal measurements over a time span of 5 years reveal that elevation gain is occurring in all settings, with the highest rates observed at elevated stream-bank zones. Elevation gain occurs primarily in response to sediment accretion, with possible minor contributions from pore-water storage and swelling of clay minerals during the monsoon season (i.e., belowground biomass and organic contribution is minimal). As a result, elevation loss and shallow subsidence in the G-B delta is unlikely to be caused by compaction of organic-rich soils, but rather appears to be controlled by seasonal lowering of the groundwater table and compaction of clay minerals. Rates of surface elevation gain in the Sundarbans greatly exceed rates of {RSLR} and more closely follow rates of {RSLR} augmented from tide range amplification, indicating that this landscape is adapting to human-induced environmental change. The proceedings of this study underscore the adaptability of the natural G-B tidal delta plain to local environmental disturbances, with the caveat that these defenses may be lost to future upstream reductions in sediment supply.},

	abstract = {This article illustrates a multi-technique frontier approach for the provenance study of silt-size sediments. The mineralogical composition of low-density and heavy-mineral fractions of four samples of fine to very coarse silt deposited on the Bengal shelf was analyzed separately for six different grain-size classes by combining grain counting under an optical microscope, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The geochemical composition was determined on both bulk-sediment samples and on their \&lt;5-\&mu;m classes. Such a \&ldquo;multiple-window\&rdquo; approach allowed capturing the full mineralogical information contained in each sample, as well as the size-dependent intra-sample variability of all compositional parameters. The comparison between grain-size distributions obtained by different methods highlighted a notable fallacy of laser granulometry, which markedly overestimated the size of the finest mode represented by fine silt and clay. As a test case, we chose to investigate sediments of the Bengal shelf, where detritus is fed from the Meghna estuary, formed by the joint Ganga and Brahmaputra Rivers and representing the largest single entry point of sediment in the world\&rsquo;s oceans. The studied samples show the typical fingerprint of orogenic detritus produced by focused erosion of collision orogens. Bengal shelf silt is characterized by a feldspatho-quartzose (F-Q) composition with a Q/F ratio decreasing from 3.0 to 1.7 with increasing grain size, plagioclase prevailing over K-feldspar, and rich transparent-heavy-mineral assemblages including mainly amphibole with epidote, and minor garnet and pyroxene. Such a detrital signature compares very closely with Brahmaputra suspended load, but mineralogical and geochemical parameters, including the anomalous decrease of the Q/F ratio with increasing grain size, consistently indicate more significant Ganga contribution for cohesive fine silt. The accurate quantitative characterization of different size fractions of Bengal shelf sediments represents an essential step to allow comparison of compositional signatures characterizing different segments of this huge source-to-sink system, from fluvial and deltaic sediments of the Himalayan foreland basin and Bengal shelf to the Bengal Fan.},

	abstract = {Sediments carried in suspension represent a fundamental part of fluvial transport. Nonetheless, largely because of technical problems, they have been hitherto widely neglected in provenance studies. In order to determine with maximum possible precision the mineralogy of suspended load collected in vertical profiles from water surface to channel bottom of Rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra, we combined Raman spectroscopy with traditional heavy-mineral and X-ray diffraction analyses, carried out separately on low-density and dense fractions of all significant size classes in each sample (multiple-window approach). Suspended load resulted to be a ternary mixture of dominant silt enriched in phyllosilicates, subordinate clay largely derived from weathered floodplains, and sand mainly produced by physical erosion and mechanical grinding during transport in Himalayan streams. Sediment concentration and grain size increase steadily with water depth. Whereas absolute concentration of clay associated with Fe-oxyhydroxides and organic matter is almost depth-invariant, regular mineralogical and consequently chemical changes from shallow to deep load result from marked increase of faster-settling, coarser, denser, or more spherical grains toward the bed. Such steady intersample compositional variability can be modeled as a mixture of clay, silt and sand modes with distinct mineralogical and chemical composition. With classical formulas describing sediment transport by turbulent diffusion, absolute and relative concentrations can be predicted at any depth for each textural mode and each detrital component. Based on assumptions on average chemistry of detrital minerals and empirical formulas to calculate their settling velocities, the suspension-sorting model successfully reproduces mineralogy and chemistry of suspended load at different depths. Principal outputs include assessment of contributions by each detrital mineral to the chemical budget, and calibration of dense minerals too rare to be precisely estimated by optical or Raman analysis but crucial in both detrital-geochronology and settling-equivalence studies. Hydrodynamic conditions during monsoonal discharge could also be evaluated. Understanding compositional variability of suspended load is a fundamental pre-requisite to correctly interpret mineralogical and geochemical data in provenance analysis of modern and ancient sedimentary deposits, to accurately assess weathering processes, sediment fluxes and erosion patterns, and to unambiguously evaluate the effects of anthropogenic modifications on the natural environment.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the natural processes that control concentration of detrital minerals and consequently chemical elements in river sand. The novelty of our approach consists in the systematic integration of detailed textural, petrographical, mineralogical and chemical data, and in the quantitative description and modeling of relationships among mineralogical and chemical variables for each sample and each grain-size class in each sample. Bed sediment in transit in the largest sedimentary system on Earth chiefly consists of fine-grained lithofeldspathoquartzose sand including rich amphibole–epidote–garnet suites, mixed with minor very-fine-grained-sand to silt subpopulations containing less heavy minerals and representing intermittent suspension. Mineralogical and particularly chemical differences between Ganga and Brahmaputra bedload are orders of magnitude less than both intersample variability associated with selective-entrainment effects and intrasample variability associated with settling-equivalence effects. Any provenance interpretation of mineralogical, chemical, or detrital-geochronology datasets therefore requires quantitative understanding of hydraulically controlled compositional variability. Mineralogical and chemical, intrasample and intersample variability can be deduced with simple equations and numerical solutions. The underlying assumptions on the chemical composition of detrital minerals, as well as the possible pitfalls, uncertainties and approximations involved are discussed. Principal results include calibration of rare {REE}-bearing ultradense minerals, ill-determined by optical analyses but crucial in both detrital-geochronology and settling-equivalence studies, and assessment of progressively changing concentration for any detrital component with increasing intensity of selective-entrainment effects. Contributions by each mineral group to the chemical budget were inferred with sufficient precision and accuracy. Although complex because of diverse controlling factors including provenance, weathering and anthropogenic pollution, mineralogical and consequently chemical variability of fluvial sediments can be quantitatively predicted. This path, difficult because of insufficient information but far from hopeless, shall eventually lead to more accurate calculation of sediment fluxes and chemical budgets, as well as to a deeper understanding of sedimentary geochemistry and fluvial sedimentology.},

In contrast, we use simulations from five numerical models to quantify the conditions under which ecogeomorphic feedbacks allow coastal wetlands to adapt to projected changes in sea level. In contrast to previous sea-level assessments, we find that non-linear feedbacks among inundation, plant growth, organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition, allow marshes to survive conservative projections of sea-level rise where suspended sediment concentrations are greater than ∼20 mg/L. Under scenarios of more rapid sea-level rise (e.g., those that include ice sheet melting), marshes will likely submerge near the end of the 21st century. Our results emphasize that in areas of rapid geomorphic change, predicting the response of ecosystems to climate change requires consideration of the ability of biological processes to modify their physical environment.},

	abstract = {Numerical modelling is one way to improve understanding of the growth and response to external factors of high tidal mudflats and marshes. Theoretically, mudflat-marsh growth is determined by the rates of minerogenic and organogenic sedimentation, the rate of change and tendency of relative sea-level, and the rate of “long-range” sediment compaction. A numerical simulation model for mudflat-marsh growth using these ideas is described and implemented for the Severn Estuary on the basis of empirical knowledge of its tidal and fine-sediment regimes and of the present-day order of magnitude of the deposition rate of fine sediment in its upper intertidal zone. The predicted curve of vertical growth relative to the tidal frame at first rises very steeply but thereafter flattens rapidly. Its precise form depends on the balance between the terms of the governing equation. When relative sea-level is rising, a marsh may grow, after a certain maturation time, to a stable elevation in the moving tidal frame that is substantially less than the elevation of the extreme tide, a situation that could inhibit peat formation. When the tendency of relative sea-level is downward, or when the rate of organogenic sedimentation is sufficiently large, a marsh after a certain emergence time may rise above the tidal frame, with the consequence that peat growth is favoured. The exploratory model is supported by a published growth curve for tidal marshes in eastern England, and by the observed internal stratification and relative elevations of the salt marshes developed along the Severn Estuary.},

We have developed a 3D model of tidal marsh accretion and channel network development that couples physical sediment transport processes with vegetation biomass productivity. Tidal flow tends to cause erosion, whereas vegetation biomass, a function of bed surface depth below high tide, influences the rate of sediment deposition and slope-driven transport processes such as creek bank slumping. With a steady, moderate rise in sea level, the model builds a marsh platform and channel network with accretion rates everywhere equal to the rate of sea-level rise, meaning water depths and biological productivity remain temporally constant. An increase in the rate of sea-level rise, or a reduction in sediment supply, causes marsh-surface depths, biomass productivity, and deposition rates to increase while simultaneously causing the channel network to expand. Vegetation on the marsh platform can promote a metastable equilibrium where the platform maintains elevation relative to a rapidly rising sea level, although disturbance to vegetation could cause irreversible loss of marsh habitat.},

	abstract = {We describe and apply a point model of the joint evolution of tidal landforms and biota which incorporates the dynamics of intertidal vegetation; benthic microbial assemblages; erosional, depositional, and sediment exchange processes; wind-wave dynamics, and relative sea level change. Alternative stable states and punctuated equilibria emerge, characterized by possible sudden transitions of the system state, governed by vegetation type, disturbances of the benthic biofilm, sediment availability, and marine transgressions or regressions. Multiple stable states are suggested to result from the interplay of erosion, deposition, and biostabilization, providing a simple explanation for the ubiquitous presence of the typical landforms observed in tidal environments worldwide. The main properties of accessible equilibrium states prove robust with respect to specific modeling assumptions and are thus identified as characteristic dynamical features of tidal systems. Halophytic vegetation emerges as a key stabilizing factor through wave dissipation, rather than a major trapping agent, because the total inorganic deposition flux is found to be largely independent of standing biomass under common supply-limited conditions. The organic sediment production associated with halophytic vegetation represents a major contributor to the overall deposition flux, thus critically affecting the ability of salt marshes to keep up with high rates of relative sea level rise. The type and number of available equilibria and the possible shifts among them are jointly driven and controlled by the available suspended sediment, the rate of relative sea level change, and vegetation and microphytobenthos colonization. The explicit description of biotic and abiotic processes thus emerges as a key requirement for realistic and predictive models of the evolution of a tidal system as a whole. The analysis of such coupled processes finally indicates that hysteretic switches between stable states arise because of differences in the threshold values of relative sea level rise inducing transitions from vegetated to unvegetated equilibria and vice versa.},

	abstract = {This study presents the validation of a zero-dimensional time-stepping physically based model ({MARSED}) to simulate the varying rates of long-term (10–100 years) tidal marsh accumulation within an estuary. First, field data on long-term tidal marsh accumulation were collected for 25 marsh sites scattered along the Scheldt estuary ({NW} Europe), based on old topographic data and radiometric and paleoenvironmental dating of sediment cores. The field data showed that estuarine marshes accumulate at highly varying rates depending on (1) the age of the marsh, (2) estuarine variations in mean high water-level ({MHWL}) rise, and (3) variations in suspended sediment concentrations ({SSCs}). As a general mechanism, young low marsh surfaces accumulate quickly and asymptotically up to an equilibrium level around {MHWL}. After this, high old marshes accumulate much slower at rates that are comparable to local {MHWL} rise. Furthermore, marsh accumulation rates are higher in the inner part than in the outer part of the estuary. This difference can be attributed to the faster {MHWL} rise and higher {SSC} values in the inner estuary. Second, the {MARSED} model was validated against the field data. The model was able to simulate the observed variations in marsh accumulation rates with good accuracy. Furthermore, the model allows to quantify the combined effect of sea-level change and {SSC} on variations in accumulation rates: they showed that tidal marshes can maintain their equilibrium elevation around {MHWL}, only if incoming {SSC} is high enough. Finally, the model allows to predict marsh accumulation rates in response to changing environmental conditions. Simulations for the next 100 years suggest that the tidal marshes in the Scheldt estuary will be able to keep up with the rising {MHWL}, unless {MHWL} rise would increase and {SSC} would decrease importantly.},

	abstract = {Existing numerical models simulating the vertical growth of tidal marshes have only, to a very limited degree, been validated using observed data. In this study, we describe a refined zero-dimensional time-stepping model, which is based on the mass balance approach of Krone [in: Coastal Sediments ’87, 1987, pp. 316–323], Allen [Mar. Geol. 95 (1990) 77–96] and French [Earth Surf. Process. Landforms 18 (1993) 63–81]. The model is applied and evaluated, using field data on suspended sediment and tidal regime as input and the historical growth of a specific minerogenic tidal marsh in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) as independent data for model testing. First, the historical rise of the marsh surface during the past 55 years is reconstructed based on land use and vegetation cover changes, which are dated using aerial photographs and which are recognised in sediment cores. After marsh formation, the marsh surface builds up very quickly and asymptotically to an equilibrium level relative to the tidal frame. Second, temporal variations in suspended sediment concentration ({SSC}) were measured above the actual marsh surface during a 1-year period. These measurements show that the {SSC}, in the water that floods the marsh surface at the beginning of an inundation, increases linearly with maximum inundation height. The application of existing models, which assume a constant incoming {SSC}, leads to an underestimation of the observed historical growth and to biased predictions under scenarios of future sea-level rise. However, after incorporation of the relationship between {SSC} and inundation height, the observed vertical growth is successfully simulated. This leads to the conclusion that not only the decrease in tidal inundation, but also the decrease in {SSC} with decreasing marsh inundation height, is of great importance to fully explain and successfully simulate the long-term vertical morphodynamics of tidal marshes.},

This preliminary study examines the potential impacts of a one-meter relative rise in sea-level rise on the existing population and infrastructure. Assuming no responses, the following major impacts were identified. (1) Area Inundation: Over 25,000 km² ({\textgreater}17.5\% of the existing land area could be inundated (lie beneath high tide). This includes 85 cities and towns, one major port (Mongla), over 800 km of roads and 28 km of railways. (2) Population Displacement: More than 13 million people ({\textgreater}11\% of the population) could be displaced by inundation. (3) Ecosystem Destruction: Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest (5,770 km²) is threatened with inundation and hence total destruction, including the world-famous Royal Bengal Tiger. (4) Agricultural Losses: Over 1.2 million ha of breadbasket land, producing 16\% of the country's rice, could be lost due to inundation. To provide minimum protection against a one-meter rise in sea level (protection against a 20-year flood), Bangladesh will have to upgrade 4,800 km of existing embankments and build 4,000 km of new embankments. This will cost over one billion U.S. dollars at 1989 prices. Natural sedimentation and the resulting vertical accretion it produces is not considered. Sea-level rise will also interact with river flow and cyclones to increase the already severe problems of flooding in Bangladesh. Therefore, sea-level rise, in specific, and global climate change in general, is of great concern to Bangladesh.]},

	abstract = {The drainage congestion and sedimentation has been major issues over the years in Kobadak river basin, Bangladesh. Kobadak River has been experiencing huge siltation over a long reach that reduces the drainage capacity of river and causing prolonged drainage congestion. It affects every sphere of life including cultivable lands, employments, culture fish production, grazing land, bio-diversity and live-stocks. Human interventions such as construction of polders, bridges and encroachment into the river for cultivation deteriorated the condition of Kobadak River. The decrease of flushing flow from upstream and substantial reduction of tidal flooding area along the river by constructing polders caused s evere siltation over a long stretch of the river. Sedimentation mainly occurs during dry season since tidal flow is restricted over the flood plain by constructing polders and there is no fresh water flow into Kobadak River from the Ganges River to flush the sediment during low tide. This study focuses on prevailing problems and solutions of long standing drainage congestion by applying {TRM} in Kobadak River basin area under Satkhira district in Jalalpur beel area. In this study to solve the drainage congestion problem for a long period of time by {TRM} process two options are suggested eac h with two different scenarios. Each option is assessed with cross dam without cross dam scenarios using {MIKE}-11 hydrodynamic modeling system.},

However, International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 354 recently discovered abundant woody debris (millimeter- to centimeter-sized fragments) preserved within the coarse sediment layers of turbidite beds recovered from 6 marine drill sites along a transect across the Bengal Fan (∼8°N, ∼3,700-m water depth) with recovery spanning 19 My. Analysis of bulk wood and lignin finds mostly lowland origins of wood delivered episodically. In the last 5 My, export included C

Substantial export of coarse woody debris in the last 1 My included one wood-rich deposit (∼0.05 Ma) that encompassed coniferous wood transported from the headwaters. In coarse layers, we found on average 0.16 weight \% {OC}, which is half the typical biospheric {OC} content of sediments exported by the modern G-B Rivers. Wood burial estimates are hampered by poor drilling recovery of sands. However, high-magnitude, low-frequency wood export events are shown to be a key mechanism for C burial in turbidites.},

	abstract = {In parts of North America and Europe, present and future sedimentary deficits translate into major areal losses of coastal salt marsh. Physically based simulations of medium- to long-term adjustment to accelerated sea-level rise are few, partly due to the difficulty in extrapolating imperfectly understood sedimentation parameters. This paper outlines the implementation and application of a simple one-dimensional mass balance model designed to simulate the vertical adjustment of predominantly minerogenic marsh surfaces to various combinations of sediment supply, tidal levels and regional subsidence. Two aspects of marsh growth are examined, with reference to sites on the macro-tidal north Norfolk coast, U.K.: (i) historical marsh growth under a scenario of effective (long-term) eustatic stability but slow regional subsidence; and (ii) marsh response to various non-linear eustatic rise scenarios for the next century. In contrast to more organogenic North American marshes, sedimentation rates in Norfolk are strongly time-dependent. Where the overall sediment budget is so closely linked to marsh age and relative elevation, some form of numerical simulation offers a preferred means of predicting the impact of accelerated sea-level rise. Simulations performed here show that only the most dramatic eustatic scenarios result in ecological ‘drowning’ and reversion to tidal flat within the conventional 2100 prediction interval. Currently favoured scenarios give rise to accretionary deficits which are clearly sustainable in the short-term, albeit at the expense of increased inundation frequency and consequent changes in the distribution of marsh flora and fauna.},

There have been, and still are, serious difficulties in achieving the full potential of {TRM} because multistakeholder processes ({MSPs}) are not effectively sustained. One major cause of ineffective {MSPs} is incompetent dealing with conflict and cooperation among stakeholders. Our research was a participatory assessment of water management events focusing on the causes, intensity, and trend of conflict and cooperation in {TRM} practices over the last 30 years. The results show that the history of {TRM} appeared more conflictive than cooperative, and also the cooperations between major stakeholders were rarely sustained in {TRM} practices. To that effect, we applied an adapted “Transboundary Water Interaction Nexus ({TWINs})” model to this local water management context, which explores the interrelatedness of conflict and cooperation for learning to deal with {MSPs} in local delta water management. The research findings should be helpful for improving participation policy in water management in Bangladesh and also facilitate {MSPs} in delta water governance elsewhere.},

Here, we report that islands in southwest Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments in the 1960s, have lost 1.0–1.5 m of elevation, whereas the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove forest has remained comparatively stable6,7,8. We attribute this elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation inside the embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest biomass, and a regionally increased tidal range. One major consequence of this elevation loss occurred in 2009 when the embankments of several large islands failed during Cyclone Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up to two years until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suffering during this time9,10, the newly reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres of tidally deposited sediment, equivalent to decades’ worth of normal sedimentation. Although many areas still lie well below mean high water and remain at risk of severe flooding, we conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled embankment breaches.},

In natural areas such as the Sundarbans National Forest, year-round inundation during spring high tides delivers sufficient sediment that enables vertical accretion to keep pace with relative sea-level rise. However, recent human modification of the landscape in the form of embankment construction has terminated this pathway of sediment delivery for much of the region, resulting in a startling elevation imbalance, with inhabited areas often sitting {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&gt;1{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m below mean high water. Restoring this landscape, or preventing land loss in the natural system, requires an understanding of how rates of water and sediment flux vary across timescales ranging from hours to months. In this study, we combine time series observations of water level, salinity, and suspended sediment concentration with ship-based measurements of large tidal-channel hydrodynamics and sediment transport. To capture the greatest possible range of variability, cross-channel transects designed to encompass a 12.4\&thinsp;h tidal cycle were performed in both dry and wet seasons during spring and neap tides.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Regional suspended sediment concentration begins to increase in August, coincident with a decrease in local salinity, indicating the arrival of the sediment-laden, freshwater plume of the combined Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna rivers. We observe profound seasonality in sediment transport, despite comparatively modest seasonal variability in the magnitude of water discharge. These observations emphasize the importance of seasonal sediment delivery from the main-stem rivers to this remote tidal region. On tidal timescales, spring tides transport an order of magnitude more sediment than neap tides in both the wet and dry seasons. In aggregate, sediment transport is flood oriented, likely as a result of tidal pumping. Finally, we note that rates of sediment and water discharge in the tidal channels are of the same scale as the annually averaged values for the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. These observations provide context for examining the relative importance of fluvial and tidal processes in what has been defined as a quintessentially tidally influenced delta in the classification scheme of Galloway (1975). These data also inform critical questions regarding the timing and magnitude of sediment delivery to the region, which are especially important in predicting and preparing for responses of the natural system to ongoing environmental change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is proposed that, for time scales relevant to anthropogenic warming, the rate of sea-level rise is roughly proportional to the magnitude of warming above the temperatures of the pre–Industrial Age. This holds to good approximation for temperature and sea-level changes during the 20th century, with a proportionality constant of 3.4 millimeters/year per °C. When applied to future warming scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this relationship results in a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level.

Other factors controlling sediment discharge (e.g., climate, runoff) appear to have secondary importance. A notable exception is the influence of human activity, climate, and geology on the rivers draining southern Asia and Oceania. Sediment fluxes from small mountainous rivers, many of which discharge directly onto active margins (e.g., western South and North America and most high-standing oceanic islands), have been greatly underestimated in previous global sediment budgets, perhaps by as much as a factor of three. In contrast, sediment fluxes to the ocean from large rivers (nearly all of which discharge onto passive margins or marginal seas) have been overestimated, as some of the sediment load is subaerially sequestered in subsiding deltas. Before the proliferation of dam construction in the latter half of this century, rivers probably discharged about 20 billion tons of sediment annually to the ocean. Prior to widespread farming and deforestation (beginning 2000-2500 yr ago), however, sediment discharge probably was less than half the present level. Sediments discharged by small mountainous rivers are more likely to escape to the deep sea during high stands of sea level by virtue of a greater impact of episodic events (i.e., flash floods and earthquakes) on small drainage basins and because of the narrow shelves associated with active margins. The resulting delta/fan deposits can be distinctly different than the sedimentary deposits derived from larger rivers that discharge onto passive margins.},

Arsenic concentrations were determined by graphite-furnace atomic-absorption spectrometry. In addition, groundwater samples collected every 2 weeks for an entire year from six tube wells were analysed for arsenic by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. {FINDINGS}: Half of the wells surveyed in Araihazar had been installed in the previous 5 years; 94\% were privately owned. Only about 48\% of the surveyed wells supplied water with an arsenic content below 50 mug/l, the current Bangladesh standard for drinking-water. Similar to other regions of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, the distribution of arsenic in Araihazar is spatially highly variable (range: 5-860 mug/l) and therefore difficult to predict. Because of this variability, however, close to 90\% of the inhabitants live within 100 m of a safe well. Monitoring of six tube wells currently meeting the 50 mug/l standard showed no indication of a seasonal cycle in arsenic concentrations coupled to the hydrological cycle. This suggests that well-switching is a viable option in Araihazar, at least for the short term. {CONCLUSIONS}: Well-switching should be more systematically encouraged in Araihazar and many other parts of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. Social barriers to well-switching need to be better understood and, if possible, overcome.},

We address here lingering concerns that As concentrations in deep tubewells might increase over time with monitoring data spanning a period of up to 5 years for 51 community wells, 115–545 ft (34–164 m) deep, installed in Araihazar upazila, Bangladesh. This exceptionally detailed data set shows that all but 4 of these community wells have consistently provided drinking water that meets the Bangladesh standard for As in drinking water of 50 μg L− 1; all but 10 community wells have also consistently met the World Health Organization ({WHO}) guideline for As of 10 μ g L− 1. Groundwater pumped from one third of the community wells does not meet the current {WHO} guideline for Mn in drinking water of 0.4 mg L− 1, although Mn concentrations are lower than in most surrounding shallow wells. In addition to As and Mn, concentrations of 10 elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Ba, Hg, Mo, Sb, Pb, and U) out of a total 19 inorganic constituents of potential health concern were monitored and found to be below their respective guideline values established by {WHO}. Further study is required to evaluate the health consequences of Mn exposure, but the increase in As concentrations in 4 community wells indicates that all deeper tubewells should be periodically re-tested.},

The most intense reduction and so severest pollution is driven by microbial degradation of buried deposits of peat. Concentrations of ammonium up to 23 mg L−1 come from microbial fermentation of buried peat and organic waste in latrines. Concentrations of phosphorus of up to 5 mg L−1 come from the release of sorbed phosphorus when {FeOOH} is reductively dissolved and from degradation of peat and organic waste from latrines. Calcium and barium in groundwater come from dissolution of detrital (and possibly pedogenic) carbonate, while magnesium is supplied by both carbonate dissolution and weathering of mica.

	abstract = {Throughout the Holocene, a large sediment load coupled with river avulsions, tectonic activity and eustasy developed the complex stratigraphy of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta. Understanding this development is useful in predicting how the delta will respond to changes in the environmental setting such as climatic shifts and sea-level rise. The complex stratigraphy is also linked to high concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic in the shallow groundwater aquifers of Bangladesh through its controls on hydrogeology and aquifer biogeochemistry. This research investigates differences in the fluvio-deltaic deposits of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, as well as differences in the tectonic setting across the lower delta plain. We investigate how these overarching controls influence stratigraphic architecture, the resulting aquifer systems, and ultimately arsenic distribution within the lower delta plain. A transect of 48 sediment cores spanning the lower delta plain of Bangladesh was drilled to a depth of 90m. Individual samples were analyzed for lithology, provenance and age to determine the stratigraphic architecture, the source of the sediments and the depositional history of the rivers. Delta stratigraphy was related to arsenic distribution by measuring groundwater arsenic near each borehole and combining this data with previously collected groundwater data. This study provides a better understanding of Holocene delta evolution and river behavior, as well as a more complete understanding of the geologic controls on arsenic and the characteristics of contaminant distribution in fluvial settings as they relate to stratigraphic features.},

	abstract = {A survey of well waters (n=3534) from throughout Bang- '
ladesh, excluding the Chitt;agong Hill Tracts, has shown
that water from 27\% of the 'shallow' tubewells, that is
wells less than 150 m deep, exceeded the Bangladesh
standard for arsenic in drinking water (50 flg L -I). 46\%
exceeded the {WHO} guideline value of 10 flg L-I. Figures
for 'deep' wells (greater than 150 m deep) were 1\% and
5\%, respectively. Since it is believed that there are a total of
some 6-11 million tubewells in Bangladesh, mostly
exploiting the depth range 10-50 m, some 1.5-2.5 million
wells are estimated to be contaminated with arsenic
according to the Bangladesh standard. 35 million people
are believed to be exposed to an arsenic concentration in
drinking water exceeding 50 flg L-I and 57 million people
exposed to a concentration exceeding 10 flg L -I.
There is a distinct regional pattern of arsenic contamination
with the greatest contamination in the south and
south-east of the country and the least contamination in
the north-west and in the uplifted areas of north-central
Bangladesh. However, there are occasional arsenic 'hot
spots' in the generally low-arsenic regions of northern
\_Bangladesh. In arsenic-contaminated areas, the large
degree of well-to-well variation within a village means that
it is diffic'ult to predict whether a given well will be contaminated
from tests carried out on neighbouring wells.
The young (Holocene) alluvial and deltaic deposits are

,I
tion' hypothesis in which pyrite oxidation in the zone of
water table fluctuation is assumed to release arsenic and
ultimately to be responsible for the groundwater arsenic
problem. There is no evidence to support the proposition
that the groundwater arsenic problem is caused by the
recent seasonal drawdown of the water table due to a
recent increase in irrigation abstraction.
Monitoring of groundwaters at two-weekly intervals at
a number of sites, and at different depths, has shown some
variation with time but there is as yet no convincing evidence
for seasonal changes. Dramatic changes in contamination
are not expected within such a short timescale. A
monitoring programme should be undertaken at a range of
sites to monitor possible long-term changes. In the three
contaminated areas studied in most detail, the arsenic concentration
increases most rapidly between 10-20 m below
ground level.
{\textbackslash}Vhile arsenic is the single greatest problem in Bangladesh
groundwaters, other elements of concern from a
health point of view, are manganese, boron and uranium.
Some 35\% of the groundwaters sampled exceeded the
{WHO} guideline value for manganese (0.5 mg L-I). The
spatial pattern of the arsenic and manganese problem areas
was significantly different and only 33\% of shallow well
waters complied with the {WHO} guideline values for both
arsenic and manganese.},

Reduction of the Fe is driven by microbial metabolism of sedimentary organic matter, which is present in concentrations as high as 6\% C.

	abstract = {Evidence is presented from three estuarine tide gauges located in the Sundarban area of southwest Bangladesh of relative sea level rise substantially in excess of the generally accepted rates from altimetry, as well as previous tide-gauge analyses. It is proposed that the difference arises from the use of Relative Mean Sea Level ({RMSL}) to characterise the present and future coastal flood hazard, since {RMSL} can be misleading in estuaries in which tidal range is changing. Three tide gauges, one located in the uninhabited mangrove forested area (Sundarban) of southwest Bangladesh, the others in the densely populated polder zone north of the present Sundarban, show rates of increase in {RMSL} ranging from 2.8mma−1 to 8.8mma−1. However, these trends in {RMSL} disguise the fact that high water levels in the polder zone have been increasing at an average rate of 15.9mma−1 and a maximum of 17.2mma−1. In an area experiencing tidal range amplification, {RMSL} will always underestimate the rise in high water levels; consequently, as an alternative to {RMSL}, the use of trends in high water maxima or ‘Effective Sea Level Rise’ ({ESLR}) is adopted as a more strategic parameter to characterise the flooding hazard potential. The rate of increase in {ESLR} is shown to be due to a combination of deltaic subsidence, including sediment compaction, and eustatic sea level rise, but principally as a result of increased tidal range in estuary channels recently constricted by embankments. These increases in {ESLR} have been partially offset by decreases in fresh water discharge in those estuaries connected to the Ganges. The recognition of increases of the effective sea level in the Bangladesh Sundarban, which are substantially greater than increases in mean sea level, is of the utmost importance to flood management in this low-lying and densely populated area.},

	abstract = {The variation of river flow within a natural range plays an important role in promoting the social-ecological sustainability of a river basin. In order to determine the extent of the natural range of variation, this study assesses hydrologic flow thresholds for the Lower Ganges River Basin. The flow threshold was calculated using twenty-two “Range of Variability ({RVA})” parameters. The impact of Farakka Dam on the Lower Ganges River flow was calculated by comparing threshold parameters for the pre-Farakka period (from 1934 to 1974) and the post-Farakka period (1975–2005). The results demonstrate that due to water diversion by the Farakka Dam, various threshold parameters, including the monthly mean of the dry season (December–May) and yearly minimum flows, have been altered significantly. The ecological consequences of such hydrologic alterations include the destruction of the breeding and raising grounds for a number of Gangetic species, the increase of salinity in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh and a reduction of fish and agricultural diversity. The major findings in this paper have a number of policy-level implications to aid water sharing mechanisms and agreements between the government of Bangladesh and India. The methodological approach presented in this study is applicable to other river basins.},

Demand for water is growing rapidly in agriculture mainly from irrigation for cereal production, the urban and industrial sector, fishery, inland navigation and salinity control. The supply of clean and uncontaminated water has fallen far short of demand owing to inadequate flows in the Ganges, pollution caused by the disposal of effluents and chemicals, salinity intrusion in the coastal area and arsenic contamination. Further, the availability of freshwater is highly seasonal depending on the presence and duration of the monsoon. The incidence of both flood and drought in a yearly cycle profoundly affects river morphology. This paper identifies various geographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors that shape the water management issues of Bangladesh. The paper mainly concerns the status and trend of these issues.},

Rice handles submergence stress by internal aeration and growth controls. A quiescence strategy based on Submergence-1A ({SUB}1A) or an escape strategy based on {SNORKEL}1 ({SK}1) and {SNORKEL}2 ({SK}2) is used for the growth controls. On the other hand, rice handles waterlogging stress by forming lysigenous aerenchyma and a barrier to radial O2 loss ({ROL}) in roots in order to supply O2 to the root tip. In this article, we summarize recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of responding to excess water stresses (i.e., submergence and waterlogging) in rice and other gramineous plants.},

	abstract = {The Southwest Coastal people of Bangladesh have introduced Tidal River Management ({TRM}) as an environmentally acceptable water resource management practice based on their indigenous knowledge of water logging of low lying coastal land. {TRM} helps to address problems resulting from different anthropogenic and structural development activities, and it has been successful in helping coastal communities to adapt to climate change and rising sea level vulnerability by forming new land in Tidal Basins. Hence, it is essential to measure sustainability impacts of {TRM} from the environmental, socio-economic and institutional perspectives. Therefore, firstly, the study identifies sustainability indicators of {TRM} considering ecosystem services and secondly, develops an inclusive conceptual framework to understand the important impacts of each indicator at various spatial and temporal scales. The conceptual framework is followed by the construction of a Sustainability Index of Tidal River Management ({SITRM}). It has advantages over the Ramsar Convention framework (2007) and the World Meteorological Organization ({WMO}) framework (2012) to measure water sustainability as it includes a sustainable model to project future vulnerability of the community, river and Tidal Basin, emphasizing on climate change issues. It also involves trade-offs analysis, livelihood analysis and {SWOT} (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis for a complete impact assessment to enable decision-makers to focus on those services most likely to be of risks and weaknesses or opportunities and strengths for the sustainability of {TRM}. Moreover, the framework is a useful guide for policymakers in identifying the sustainability impacts of {TRM} so that they can choose best coping strategies for coastal people to effectively deal with adverse effects of water-logging and undesired climatic events as well as environmental and socio-economic changes in coastal areas.},

	abstract = {The southwest coastal delta of Bangladesh is not only geographically home to a dynamic interplay between land and water, and between fresh surface water and saline tides, but also to contentious debates on flood management policy. It has been argued that dealing with delta floods in this region boils down to adopting either open or closed approaches. This paper longitudinally structures the open-or-closed debate based on a number of emblematic water management projects in the region. Departing from a typical open wetland history, river and polder embankments increasingly started to constrain flood dynamics. Upheaval among rural populations in response to the negative impacts of hydraulic engineering plans and works coalesced in efforts to restore open approaches, synthesized in the Tidal River Management concept. Its resemblance to historic overflow irrigation is often used politically as a yardstick to challenge the dominant hydraulic engineering paradigm. This paper argues that dealing with floods in Bangladesh requires plans, policies and projects formulated against the historic background of complex interactions among social processes, environmental dynamics and technological interventions: a lesson to be incorporated in on-going policy-making processes and long-term delta management plans.},

However, which research method or approach is best suited to a particular inquiry is frequently debated and discussed. Working Together examines how different methods have promoted various theoretical developments related to collective action and the commons, and demonstrates the importance of cross-fertilization involving multimethod research across traditional boundaries. The authors look at why cross-fertilization is difficult to achieve, and they show ways to overcome these challenges through collaboration. The authors provide numerous examples of collaborative, multimethod research related to collective action and the commons. They examine the pros and cons of case studies, meta-analyses, large-N field research, experiments and modeling, and empirically grounded agent-based models, and they consider how these methods contribute to research on collective action for the management of natural resources. Using their findings, the authors outline a revised theory of collective action that includes three elements: individual decision making, microsituational conditions, and features of the broader social-ecological context. Acknowledging the academic incentives that influence and constrain how research is conducted, Working Together reworks the theory of collective action and offers practical solutions for researchers and students across a spectrum of disciplines.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is frequently visited by natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, storm surges, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and “norwesters.” Of these, tropical cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and associated storm surges are the most disastrous. There are various reasons for the disastrous effects of cyclones and storm surges in Bangladesh. Superimposed on these disastrous effects, climate change and any consequent sea level rise are likely to add fuel to the fire. Arise in temperature is likely to change cyclone activity: cyclone intensity, if not cyclone frequency, may increase. As a result, storm surges may also increase substantially. Sea level rise, an increase in cyclone intensity, and consequent increases in storm surge heights will have disastrous effects on a deltaic country like Bangladesh, which is not much above the mean sea level. This paper examines the climatology of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal for the last 110 years and trends in cyclone frequency and intensity. The phenomenon of storm surges in the Bay of Bengal is examined along with the primary reasons for the severity of storm surges in Bangladesh. The paper discusses both qualitatively and quantitatively the impacts of rises in temperature on tropical cyclone intensity in Bangladesh. With the use of a mathematical model developed for the simulation of storm surges along the Bangladesh coast, various scenarios of storm surges are developed. Using lower and upper bounds of sea surface temperature rise of 2 and 4°C and of sea level rise of 0.3 and 1.0 m (according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change standard), the model simulates the maximum possible surges that are likely to occur under these conditions.},

	abstract = {Pattern recognition-based seismic facies analysis techniques are commonly used in modern quantitative seismic interpretation. However, interpreters often treat techniques such as artificial neural networks and self-organizing maps ({SOMs}) as a “black box” that somehow correlates a suite of attributes to a desired geomorphological or geomechanical facies. Even when the statistical correlations are good, the inability to explain such correlations through principles of geology or physics results in suspicion of the results. The most common multiattribute facies analysis begins by correlating a suite of candidate attributes to a desired output, keeping those that correlate best for subsequent analysis. The analysis then takes place in attribute space rather than (xx{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}x{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, yy{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}y{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, and zz{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}z{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}) space, removing spatial trends often observed by interpreters. We add a stratigraphy layering component to a {SOM} model that attempts to preserve the intersample relation along the vertical axis. Specifically, we use a mode decomposition algorithm to capture the sedimentary cycle pattern as an “attribute.” If we correlate this attribute to the training data, it will favor {SOM} facies maps that follow stratigraphy. We apply this workflow to a Barnett Shale data set and find that the constrained {SOM} facies map shows layers that are easily overlooked on traditional unconstrained {SOM} facies map.},

However, without consistent geological information, parameters such as the number of facies and even the input seismic attributes are usually chosen in an empirical way. In this context, we propose two new semiautomatic alternative methods. In the first one, we use the clustering of the Kohonen self-organizing maps ({SOMs}) as a new way to build seismic facies maps and to estimate the number of seismic facies. In the second method, we use wavelet transforms to identify seismic trace singularities in each geologically oriented segment, and then we build the seismic facies map using the clustering of the {SOM}. We tested both methods using synthetic and real seismic data from the Namorado deepwater giant oilfield in Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. The results confirm that we can estimate the appropriate number of seismic facies through the clustering of the {SOM}. We also showed that we can improve the seismic facies analysis by using trace singularities detected by the wavelet transform technique. This workflow presents the advantage of being less sensitive to horizon interpretation errors, thus resulting in an improved seismic facies analysis.},

The consequent losses in agricultural production due to the inundation of about 128 thousand hectare crop land were noticed in Jessore, Satkhira and Khulna districts that directly affects the life and livelihood of about one million people. Continuous climate change would put extra burdens on the social and economic challenges that the poorest already face, emphasizing and increasing their vulnerabilities due to the dependence of their livelihoods on climate sensitive natural resources and their weak social protection structures. For removing water logging effect, plinth rising and elevating the local habitats and physical infrastructures can be considered as an immediate and short-term measure whereas operation of Tidal River Management ({TRM}) technology might be considered for long-term or permanent solution for raising the low lands or beels. The dead or silted-up rivers, canals, ponds and irrigation channels can be excavated or re-excavated by operating the major workfare social safety net programmes of the government like Food-for-Work ({FFW}) or Cash-for-Work ({CFW}) and the excavated soil can be utilized for creating, maintaining or raising the rural roads, polder/embankment and related other infrastructures which are quite crucial for mitigating the flood or water logging problem in the region. For continuing crop production local people are engaged in floating agriculture, crop production with Sorjan method, and fish cultivation in lowland to utilize the water-logged land around the southern region. They elevate and widen the surroundings of that waterlogged land utilized for vegetable and fruit production. Such local practices can properly be screened and piloted befitting to climate change adaptation to the water congestion areas of the country. The interventions may also be applicable to other agro-climatic regions or countries suffering from the similar problem.},

In order to address these challenges, local people have identiﬁed ‘tidal river management ({TRM})’ as a comprehensive approach for sustainably managing this part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin. However, due to institutional limitations, mismanagement and social conﬂicts, application of the {TRM} approach is not straightforward. In order to identify existing implementation barriers and to eﬀectively apply the {TRM} approach, a transdisciplinary approach is examined for its potential to inform the re-shaping of {TRM} governing values and actions. It is argued that a thorough application of a transdisciplinary framework is essential, supported by the active involvement of key agencies and local stakeholders. The proposed transdisciplinary framework can potentially be applied to {TRM} projects for solving waterlogging and associated problems in order to achieve greater sustainability of the area.},

	abstract = {An {ANSI}-standard Fortran 77 program solves the steady, two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation describing a turbid hypopycnal plume emanating from a river mouth. The model solves for the extent of the plume as a non-dimensioned inventory of sediment mass on an axial-lateral grid. The basis for the model is a derivation by Albertson for a two-dimensional momentum-driven submerged jet. Particle settling is based on the scavenging model of Syvitski. {PLUME} is robust but fast enough to handle the sedimentation beneath a river plume flowing into a coastal sea on a daily basis. Designed for speed, the model may be run with daily-changing river input characteristics (flow velocity, river mouth dimensions, sediment concentrations of up to ten grain sizes) for many (up to thousands of) years. {PLUME}1.1 works with input from long-term field observations or from climate-hydrologic simulations. The model provides for an improved geological simulator of land-sea interaction and the delivery of sediment onto continental margins. The model can be used to simulate flow into both open-coast and semi-enclosed basins. Open-coast plume simulations include the flood-dominated Eel River margin, Northern California, where a three-day flood event could supply more sediment than the previous seven years combined. A semi-enclosed basin example is from a fjord-basin from British Columbia, where model simulations agree well with sediment concentration observations.},

	abstract = {We consider the response of marshland to accelerations in the rate of sea-level rise by utilizing two previously described numerical models of marsh elevation. In a model designed for the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium–{SW} Netherlands), a feedback between inundation depth and suspended sediment concentrations allows marshes to quickly adjust their elevation to a change in sea-level rise rate. In a model designed for the North Inlet Estuary (South Carolina), a feedback between inundation and vegetation growth allows similar adjustment. Although the models differ in their approach, we find that they predict surprisingly similar responses to sea-level change. Marsh elevations adjust to a step change in the rate of sea-level rise in about 100 years. In the case of a continuous acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise, modeled accretion rates lag behind sea-level rise rates by about 20 years, and never obtain equilibrium. Regardless of the style of acceleration, the models predict approximately 6–14cm of marsh submergence in response to historical sea-level acceleration, and 3–4cm of marsh submergence in response to a projected scenario of sea-level rise over the next century. While marshes already low in the tidal frame would be susceptible to these depth changes, our modeling results suggest that factors other than historical sea-level acceleration are more important for observations of degradation in most marshes today.},

	abstract = {Since the {IPCC} Third Assessment Report ({TAR}), our understanding of the implications of climate change for coastal systems and low-lying areas (henceforth referred to as ‘coasts’) has increased substantially and six important policy-relevant messages have emerged. Coasts are experiencing the adverse consequences of hazards related to climate and sea level (very high confidence). Coasts are highly vulnerable to extreme events, such as storms, which impose substantial costs on coastal societies [6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.5.2]. Annually, about 120 million people are exposed to tropical cyclone hazards, which killed 250,000 people from 1980 to 2000 [6.5.2]. Through the 20th century, global rise of sea level contributed to increased coastal inundation, erosion and ecosystem losses, but with considerable local and regional variation due to other factors [6.2.5, 6.4.1]. Late 20th century effects of rising temperature include loss of sea ice, thawing of permafrost and associated coastal retreat, and more frequent coral bleaching and mortality [6.2.5]. Coasts will be exposed to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, over coming decades due to climate change and sea-level rise (very high confidence). Anticipated climate-related changes include: an accelerated rise in sea level of up to 0.6 m or more by 2100; a further rise in sea surface temperatures by up to 3°C; an intensification of tropical and extratropical cyclones; larger extreme waves and storm surges; altered precipitation/run-off; and ocean acidification [6.3.2]. These phenomena will vary considerably at regional and local scales, but the impacts are virtually certain to be overwhelmingly negative [6.4, 6.5.3].},

	abstract = {Scale issues have significant implications for the analysis of social and biophysical processes in complex systems. These same scale implications are likewise considerations for the design and application of models of landcover change. Scale issues have wide-ranging effects from the representativeness of data used to validate models to aggregation errors introduced in the model structure. This paper presents an analysis of how scale issues affect an agent-based model ({ABM}) of landcover change developed for a research area in the Midwest, {USA}. The research presented here explores how scale factors affect the design and application of agent-based landcover change models. The {ABM} is composed of a series of heterogeneous agents who make landuse decisions on a portfolio of cells in a raster-based programming environment. The model is calibrated using measures of fit derived from both spatial composition and spatial pattern metrics from multi-temporal landcover data interpreted from historical aerial photography. A model calibration process is used to find a best-fit set of parameter weights assigned to agents' preferences for different landuses (agriculture, pasture, timber production, and non-harvested forest). Previous research using this model has shown how a heterogeneous set of agents with differing preferences for a portfolio of landuses produces the best fit to landcover changes observed in the study area. The scale dependence of the model is explored by varying the resolution of the input data used to calibrate the model (observed landcover), ancillary datasets that affect land suitability (topography), and the resolution of the model landscape on which agents make decisions. To explore the impact of these scale relationships the model is run with input datasets constructed at the following spatial resolutions: 60, 90, 120, 150, 240, 300 and 480 m. The results show that the distribution of landuse-preference weights differs as a function of scale. In addition, with the gradient descent model fitting method used in this analysis the model was not able to converge to an acceptable fit at the 300 and 480 m spatial resolutions. This is a product of the ratio of the input cell resolution to the average parcel size in the landscape. This paper uses these findings to identify scale considerations in the design, development, validation and application of {ABMs} of landcover change.},
